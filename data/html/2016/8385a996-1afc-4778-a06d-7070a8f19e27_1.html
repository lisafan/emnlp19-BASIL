        <i>Title: Did Ruth Bader Ginsburg Cross The Line With Her Donald Trump Comments?</i><br><br>
        <div id="article" onmouseup="annotate()"><span class="para" id="p0">Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg hasn’t been shy in recent days about the prospect of a Donald Trump presidency, joking that she might move to New Zealand if it ever happens.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p0">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p1">“I can’t imagine what this place would be ― I can’t imagine what the country would be ― with Donald Trump as our president,” Ginsburg told The New York Times in an article published Sunday.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p1">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p2">“For the country, it could be four years.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p2">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p3">For the court, it could be ― I don’t even want to contemplate that.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p3">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p4">That tracks a comment she made in a separate interview with The Associated Press, when the justice stopped short of noting she’d rather have presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton making future appointments to the Supreme Court.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p4">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p5">“I don’t want to think about that possibility,” Ginsburg said when asked to consider Trump in the role of appointer-in-chief.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p5">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p6">Now a number of legal academics and Supreme Court observers are raising questions about the propriety of Ginsburg’s candor and what it might mean for the court’s integrity ― with some suggesting she might have to recuse herself from considering any Trump-related case that reaches the high court.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p6">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p7">“The other justices should hold an intervention, and tell her to be quiet or step down,” wrote Josh Blackman, a Houston College of Law professor who frequently writes about the high court.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p7">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p8">“This isn’t funny anymore.” He added that Ginsburg’s comments are “beyond the pale.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p8">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p9">Rick Hasen, another avid court watcher who specializes in election law, wrote that Ginsburg’s statements could very well lead a “reasonable person” to question her impartiality in a future politically charged case.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p9">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p10">“I think this is ultimately a question for judicial ethicists, but I do think following these comments it is a legitimate question to raise, should Donald Trump’s campaign come to the Court with any legal questions before the election,” he wrote in his widely read Election Law Blog.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p10">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p11">Dmitry Bam, a professor at the University of Maine School of Law who has written on judicial recusals and ethics, said “there is little question that she has crossed a line.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p11">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p12">“For a court that cares a great deal about appearances, this certainly creates the appearance that justices take sides in elections,” Bam wrote in an email.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p12">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p13">“And if Trump v. Clinton arises in the fall, I would say that there is at the very least an appearance of bias if Justice Ginsburg participates.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p13">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p14">Under federal law, justices must step aside from cases where their “impartiality might reasonably be questioned” ― and they did so in 180 cases during the court’s last term, according to a new analysis by Fix the Court, a group that pushes for structural reform at the Supreme Court.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p14">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p15">Fix the Court found that the bulk of recent recusals were due to the justices’ prior work as appellate judges or in government positions.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p15">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p16">Other recusals were related to stock ownership and family ties to judges or lawyers who participated in earlier stages of the cases.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p16">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p17">But recusals for political views or implicit support for certain positions are exceedingly rare, even in the face of a code of judicial conduct that guides federal judges on extra-judicial activities and how to avoid even the appearance of impropriety.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p17">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p18">Even with that guidance and other self-imposed checks in place, the justices have time and again declined to step aside in cases of high political salience ― most recently in the same-sex marriage cases, where Ginsburg and Justices Elena Kagan and Clarence Thomas all took part despite calls for them to recuse.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p18">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p19">“I’m not aware [that] any justice before has ever commented on the merits or demerits of a presidential candidate,” said Ed Whelan, the president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center and a frequent contributor to the conservative National Review Online, where he has chronicled this episode and what he deems Ginsburg’s “remarkable record of indiscretions.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p19">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p20">“I may very well share her concerns about Donald Trump ... but the ethics concerns don’t depend on the soundness or unsoundness of the candidate,” Whelan added.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p20">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p21">But what if this is less a question about ethics and more about wanting our judges to be candid about their positions and biases ― and that the political process itself has done away with the veneer that the high court is entirely apolitical?</span>	<button class="sent" id="p21">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p22">“Most people now recognize that judges are heavily influenced by their personal beliefs and experiences,” said Bam, of the Maine School of Law.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p22">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p23">“We have watched one party refuse to hold hearings based the politics of the president and his potential nominees.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p23">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p24">Judges time their retirements to coincide with a certain party being in office.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p24">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p25">And the 5-4 decision in Bush v. Gore, along partisan lines, also shows the political nature of the court,” Bam said.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p25">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p26">“So perhaps the pretense that judges are nonpartisan and apolitical does more harm than good.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p26">S</button><br><br>
