        <i>Title: Ryan goes on offense over Medicare, accuses Obama of treating program like 'piggy bank'</i><br><br>
        <div id="article" onmouseup="annotate()"><span class="para" id="p0">Paul Ryan went on offense Tuesday in response to criticism over his Medicare plan, using an interview with Fox News coupled with a new TV ad to claim President Obama’s health care plan treats the treasured entitlement like a “piggy bank,” while the “Romney-Ryan” plan preserves it.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p0">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p1">Ryan, in his first one-on-one interview since being named Saturday as Mitt Romney’s running mate, told Fox News on Tuesday he thinks Medicare can be a winning issue for their campaign.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p1">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p2">"We're the ones who are offering a plan to save Medicare, to protect Medicare, to strengthen Medicare," Ryan said.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p2">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p3">"We're the ones who are not raiding Medicare to pay for ObamaCare.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p3">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p4">… We're the ones continuing the guarantee of Medicare for people in or near retirement."</span>	<button class="sent" id="p4">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p5">He added: “President Obama is actually damaging Medicare for current seniors.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p5">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p6">It's irrefutable and that's why I think this is a debate we want to have, and that's the debate we're going to win.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p6">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p7">The comments signal Ryan and Romney are prepared to dig in and fight back, as Democrats lob charges that Ryan stands for “ending Medicare as we know it.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p7">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p8">The Obama campaign used that line Monday in a Web video timed for Romney’s arrival in Florida, with its large senior population.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p8">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p9">The video pointed to Ryan’s budget proposals, which include significant changes to Medicare.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p9">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p10">The Romney campaign retorted with an ad of its own Tuesday.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p10">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p11">The ad says: “You paid in to Medicare for years … now when you need it, Obama has cut $716 billion from Medicare.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p11">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p12">Why? To pay for ObamaCare.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p12">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p13">Ryan told Fox News the campaign is trying to show the “clear contrast” between what Republicans propose and what Obama’s health care law does.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p13">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p14">Ryan wants to make changes to Medicare for those retiring a decade from now but leave benefits for current retirees and those retiring soon in place.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p14">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p15">“They turned Medicare into a piggy bank to finance ObamaCare,” Ryan said.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p15">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p16">“And we want to point that out.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p16">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p17">And we want to … restore those cuts to prevent that raid.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p17">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p18">… And so we propose no changes to anybody in or near retirement so that the guarantee of Medicare is for them.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p18">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p19">That's a clear contrast with President Obama's plan.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p19">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p20">The Obama campaign is disputing that argument.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p20">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p21">Obama campaign spokeswoman Lis Smith described the new Romney-Ryan ad on the subject as “dishonest and hypocritical,” considering Ryan’s own proposals for Medicare.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p21">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p22">“The savings his ad attacks do not cut a single guaranteed Medicare benefit, and Mitt Romney embraced the very same savings when he promised he’d sign Paul Ryan’s budget,” Smith said.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p22">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p23">“Because the president is eliminating subsidies to insurance companies and cutting waste and fraud, we’ve extended the life of Medicare by eight years.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p23">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p24">The truth is that the Romney-Ryan budget would end Medicare as we know it: people with Medicare would be left with nothing but a voucher in place of the guaranteed benefits they rely on today.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p24">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p25">Both sides are being selective in how they describe each other’s plans.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p25">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p26">The Ryan proposal, submitted again in the House earlier this year, would a decade from now give seniors government payments to purchase private plans or stay within the current system.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p26">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p27">Ryan says this is to preserve Medicare, not “end” it, as Obama’s campaign claims.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p27">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p28">But while Ryan slams the health care overhaul for cutting Medicare, even he acknowledged that his own plan achieves “savings” for Medicare in the long run.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p28">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p29">Though he doesn’t use the word “cuts,” the plan would slow the rate of benefit growth for seniors according to the Congressional Budget Office.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p29">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p30">And the ObamaCare cuts he referenced would likely come in the form of lower payments to providers.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p30">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p31">A Romney campaign aide, though, said “that’s a distinction without a difference” since the “provider passes that reduction along to” patients.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p31">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p32">In his interview with Fox News, Ryan also hammered Obama for what he called his “utter failure when it comes to creating jobs.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p32">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p33">Amplifying the Romney campaign message, he said Obama’s heavy borrowing is dragging down economic growth – he also claimed the “hope and change campaign of '08 has become the blame and attack campaign of 2012.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p33">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p34">Ryan offered new insight as well on how Romney and Ryan came to bond in the months before he was announced as running mate.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p34">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p35">He recalled when he was campaigning with Romney earlier this year ahead of the Wisconsin primary.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p35">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p36">“We spent about five days on the road, five working hour or so days,” he said.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p36">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p37">“And in between all of those stops, driving from, you know, Appleton to Green Bay to Janesville to Milwaukee, we got to know each other.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p37">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p38">We conversed on policy issues, on where to take the country.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p38">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p39">And sooner or later, we basically started sharing the microphones at these town hall meetings and we just kind of developed a chemistry with one another and a mutual understanding with each other.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p39">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p40">Ryan said he doesn’t know whether he had a “special place” but it was “very clear we thought the same on these issues.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p40">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p41">“When he asked me to join the ticket, he basically said to me, 'You share my values and you have the kind of experience that could be a complement to my experience to getting this country back on track, to creating jobs, to getting people back to work, to saving this country from a debt crisis,'" Ryan said.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p41">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p42">Ryan also discussed his affection for novelist Ayn Rand, saying “Atlas Shrugged” triggered his interest in economics.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p42">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p43">He said he doesn’t share her overall philosophy but said her books “showed how the pitfalls of socialism can hurt the economy.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p43">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p44">Obama, meanwhile, took on Ryan for the second straight day Tuesday, using a stop in Oskaloosa, Iowa, to criticize Ryan’s and Romney’s tax plan.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p44">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p45">“You may have heard that Governor Romney just chose his running mate, Congressman Ryan.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p45">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p46">He's a good man. He's a family man.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p46">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p47">He's the ideological leader of the Republicans in Congress,” Obama said.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p47">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p48">“And he's an articulate spokesperson for Governor Romney's views.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p48">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p49">The problem is, those views are wrong.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p49">S</button><br><br>
