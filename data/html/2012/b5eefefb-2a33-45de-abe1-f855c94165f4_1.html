        <i>Title: Sparks fly as Biden, Ryan face off in feisty vice presidential debate</i><br><br>
        <div id="article" onmouseup="annotate()"><span class="para" id="p0">In a head-to-head battle of proxies, Vice President Biden wasted no time Thursday trying to do what many Democrats felt President Obama failed to against Mitt Romney, going on offense with an often disdainful attack on Paul Ryan -- who stood his ground against a barrage of Biden grins, guffaws, snickers and interruptions.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p0">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p1">The dueling running mates turned the lone vice presidential debate into an uncharacteristically feisty affair, scrapping over everything from the economy to Libya to taxes.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p1">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p2">But it was the vice president who set the aggressive tone, blatantly striving to hit the reset after President Obama was panned for his lackluster performance at last week's opening debate.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p2">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p3">If Obama was too cold, Biden at times bordered on too hot, analysts said afterward.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p3">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p4">He chuckled and smirked through many of Ryan's responses.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p4">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p5">But unlike Obama a week ago, he let few points go unchallenged.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p5">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p6">Biden went after the Romney/Ryan ticket with a directness that Obama did not.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p6">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p7">Notably, he hammered Mitt Romney over his secretly videotaped comment in which he said he doesn't have to worry about the "47 percent" of Americans who don't pay federal income taxes.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p7">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p8">"These people are my mom and dad, the people I grew up with, my neighbors," Biden said, adding he's "had it up to here" with those kinds of comments.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p8">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p9">Ryan shot back, in reference to Biden's tendency to make gaffes: "As the vice president very well knows ... sometimes the words don't come out of your mouth the right way."</span>	<button class="sent" id="p9">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p10">"But I always say what I mean," Biden responded.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p10">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p11">Ryan accused Obama of "projecting weakness" with his foreign policy, particularly in his response to the terror attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p11">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p12">At home, he accused the administration of presiding over a shoddy recovery.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p12">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p13">"This is not what a real recovery looks like," Ryan said.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p13">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p14">Whether the debate will alter the course of the race remains to be seen.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p14">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p15">There are two more presidential debates on the calendar, and the polls have started to swing in Romney's favor.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p15">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p16">The tightening was reflected in the candidates' attitude onstage Thursday, each loath to give the other too many seconds of speech-time without a challenge.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p16">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p17">The economy, the budget deficit and foreign policy were central.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p17">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p18">Each candidate made frequent appeals to the middle class, Biden by pledging to protect programs in the federal budget and Ryan by pledging to grow the economy for everybody.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p18">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p19">Ryan opened the debate with tough criticism of the Obama administration over its handling of the Libya terror attack.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p19">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p20">"What we are watching on our TV screens is the unraveling of the Obama foreign policy," Ryan said.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p20">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p21">With the moderator, ABC News' Martha Raddatz, opening the debate with a question about the Libya strike, which happened a month ago Thursday, Ryan criticized the administration for waiting more than a week after the strike to call it a coordinated terror attack.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p21">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p22">"This is becoming more troubling by the day.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p22">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p23">They first blamed the YouTube video.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p23">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p24">Now they're trying to blame the Romney/Ryan ticket for making this an issue," he said.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p24">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p25">Ryan was referring to a claim by an Obama aide earlier Thursday that the only reason the attack had entered the political debate was because of Romney's criticism - a claim Romney rejected.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p25">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p26">Biden was quick to retort: "With all due respect, that's just a bunch of malarkey.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p26">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p27">... Not a single thing he said is accurate."</span>	<button class="sent" id="p27">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p28">He added: "This talk about this weakness, I don't understand what my friend's talking about."</span>	<button class="sent" id="p28">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p29">Biden also criticized Romney for making a "political statement"on the night of the attack, a reference to Romney's criticism of the U.S. Embassy in Cairo's early response to protests there.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p29">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p30">On the question of why the administration initially claimed the attack was the result of a protest, Biden explained "the intelligence community told us that."</span>	<button class="sent" id="p30">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p31">The face-off Thursday night was taking on outsized importance for a vice presidential debate.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p31">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p32">After Obama's debate performance last week, the pressure was on Biden to recapture the momentum -- while equally on Ryan to prevent the Obama ticket from blunting Romney's surge.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p32">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p33">Ryan referred to the weight on Biden's shoulders about mid-way through, as the two talked over each other on Medicare.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p33">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p34">"Mr. vice president, I know you're under a lot of duress to make up for lost ground, but I think people would be better served if we don't keep interrupting each other," Ryan said.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p34">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p35">On Medicare, Biden charged that the Republican ticket's plan would raise costs for future seniors with a de facto "voucher" system.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p35">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p36">"Their ideas are old and their ideas are bad and they eliminate the guarantee of Medicare," he said.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p36">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p37">Ryan shot back: "They got caught with their hand in the cookie jar turning Medicare into a piggy bank for ObamaCare."</span>	<button class="sent" id="p37">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p38">The debate veered across the spectrum of topics from the campaign trail.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p38">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p39">On Iran's nuclear program, Biden repeatedly suggested Romney and Ryan would too readily choose the military option to stop it.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p39">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p40">On abortion, he cautioned that the next president will get to choose one or two justices on the Supreme Court -- "that's how close Roe v. Wade is."</span>	<button class="sent" id="p40">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p41">Ryan, toward the end of the debate, warned that a "debt crisis is coming" and claimed the sitting president offers little more than speeches to address the deficit.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p41">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p42">"That's what we get in this administration -- speeches.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p42">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p43">But we're not getting leadership," he said.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p43">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p44">In a matter of days, Romney has picked up steam in both battleground and national polls.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p44">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p45">The latest Fox News national poll of likely voters showed Romney edging Obama, 46 percent to 45 percent.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p45">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p46">Obama has acknowledged he had a "bad night" in his debate last week, but the campaign indicates it will be more aggressive going forward.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p46">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p47">After Biden's more feisty performance Thursday, Obama campaign manager Jim Messina quipped that he's a "happy warrior" for the middle class.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p47">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p48">The final presidential debates will be held Oct. 16 and Oct. 22.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p48">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p49">The next one will be a town hall format focusing on a range of issues, and the last one will focus exclusively on foreign policy.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p49">S</button><br><br>
