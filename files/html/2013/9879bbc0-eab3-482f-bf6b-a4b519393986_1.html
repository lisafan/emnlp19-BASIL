        <i>Title: Republicans challenge Clinton claims on budget cuts, Benghazi cable</i><br><br>
        <div id="article" onmouseup="annotate()"><span class="para" id="p0">Republicans challenge Clinton claims on budget cuts, Benghazi cable</span>	<button class="sent" id="p0">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p1">Republicans are challenging a host of statements made by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Democratic allies during Wednesday's heated Libya testimony -- claiming that complaints about a lack of funding are bogus and questioning the secretary's insistence she never saw urgent cables warning about the danger of an attack.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p1">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p2">The questions come as the Senate Foreign Relations Committee begins its confirmation hearing for Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., who was tapped to replace Clinton at the department.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p2">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p3">One issue that may come up is the department's funding.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p3">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p4">Assertions that State Department posts are left vulnerable because Congress has decided not to fully fund security requests pervaded Wednesday's hearings.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p4">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p5">"Shame on the House for ... failing to adequately fund the administration's request," Rep. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., said</span>	<button class="sent" id="p5">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p6">Clinton, in turn, affirmed their claims, saying budget issues are a "bipartisan problem."</span>	<button class="sent" id="p6">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p7">Budget numbers, though, actually show the overall diplomatic security budget has ballooned over the past decade.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p7">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p8">Democrats point to modest decreases in funding in recent years, and the fact that Congress has approved less than was requested.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p8">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p9">But Congress often scales back the administration's requests, and not just for the State Department.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p9">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p10">And the complaints tend to overlook the fact that the overall security budget has more than doubled since fiscal 2004.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p10">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p11">For that year, the budget was $640 million.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p11">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p12">It steadily climbed to $1.6 billion in fiscal 2010.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p12">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p13">It dipped to $1.5 billion the following year and roughly $1.35 billion in fiscal 2012 -- still far more than it was a decade ago.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p13">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p14">Slightly more has been requested for fiscal 2013.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p14">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p15">It's difficult to tell how much was specifically allocated for Benghazi.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p15">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p16">Tripoli was the only post mentioned in the department's fiscal 2013 request -- funding for that location did slip, from $11.5 million in fiscal 2011 to $10.1 million the following year.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p16">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p17">Slightly more has been requested for fiscal 2013.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p17">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p18">Still, then-Deputy Assistant Secretary for Diplomatic Security Charlene Lamb testified in October that the size of the attack -- and not the money -- was the issue.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p18">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p19">Asked if there was any budget consideration that led her not to increase the security force, she said: "No."</span>	<button class="sent" id="p19">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p20">She added: "This was an unprecedented attack in size."</span>	<button class="sent" id="p20">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p21">Asked again about budget issues, Lamb said: "Sir, if it's a volatile situation, we will move assets to cover that."</span>	<button class="sent" id="p21">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p22">Asked Wednesday about Lamb's testimony, Clinton noted that the review board that examined the Libya attack found budget issues have played a role.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p22">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p23">"That's why you have an independent group like an (Accountability Review Board); that's why it was created to look at everything," Clinton said.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p23">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p24">But Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., said "any suggestion that this is a budget issue is off base, or political."</span>	<button class="sent" id="p24">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p25">Other lawmakers further complained that the State Department has spent millions on lower-priority projects that could have been spent on security.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p25">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p26">Another pivotal issue Wednesday dealt with an Aug. 16 cable.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p26">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p27">That cable summarized an emergency meeting the day before by the U.S. Mission in Benghazi and warned the consulate could not defend against a "coordinated attack."</span>	<button class="sent" id="p27">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p28">That cable is seen as one of the vital warnings sent out of Libya in the months leading up to the attack.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p28">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p29">But, to the dismay of lawmakers, Clinton repeatedly said she never saw it.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p29">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p30">"That cable did not come to my attention.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p30">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p31">I have made it very clear that the security cables did not come to my attention or above the assistant secretary level," Clinton said.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p31">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p32">"I'm not aware of anyone within my office, within the secretary's office, having seen the cable."</span>	<button class="sent" id="p32">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p33">Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, said "somebody within your office should have seen this cable."</span>	<button class="sent" id="p33">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p34">"An emergency meeting was held and a cable sent out on Aug. 16 by the ambassador himself, warning of what could happen.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p34">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p35">And this meant this cable went unnoticed by your office.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p35">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p36">That's the bottom line," he said.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p36">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p37">Clinton said it was "very disappointing" that "inadequacies" were found in the "responsiveness of our team here in Washington," and said "it's something we're fixing and intend to put into place protocols and systems to make sure it doesn't happen again."</span>	<button class="sent" id="p37">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p38">The secretary tried to explain that "1.43 million cables" come through the department every year.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p38">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p39">They are addressed to her but in many cases do not go to her.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p39">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p40">Rather, they go through "the bureaucracy."</span>	<button class="sent" id="p40">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p41">Republicans argue the Aug. 16 cable was rather high priority.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p41">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p42">As Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., put it, "Libya has to have been one of the hottest of hot spots around the world."</span>	<button class="sent" id="p42">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p43">He claimed that not knowing about their security requests "really, I think, cost these people their lives."</span>	<button class="sent" id="p43">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p44">"Had I been president at the time, and I found that you did not read the cables from Benghazi, you did not read the cables from Ambassador Stevens, I would have relieved you of your post.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p44">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p45">I think it's inexcusable," Paul said.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p45">S</button><br><br>
