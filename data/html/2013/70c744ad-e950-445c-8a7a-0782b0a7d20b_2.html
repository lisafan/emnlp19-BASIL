        <i>Title: Gay Marriages Get Recognition From the I.R.S.</i><br><br>
        <div id="article" onmouseup="annotate()"><span class="para" id="p0">WASHINGTON — All same-sex couples who are legally married will be recognized as such for federal tax purposes, even if the state where they live does not recognize their union, the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service said Thursday.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p0">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p1">It is the broadest federal rule change to come out of the landmark Supreme Court decision in June that struck down the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act, and a sign of how quickly the government is moving to treat gay couples in the same way that it does straight couples.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p1">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p2">The June decision found that same-sex couples were entitled to federal benefits, but left open the question of how Washington would actually administer them.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p2">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p3">The Treasury Department answered some of those questions on Thursday.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p3">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p4">As of the 2013 tax year, same-sex spouses who are legally married will not be able to file federal tax returns as if either were single.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p4">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p5">Instead, they must file together as “married filing jointly” or individually as “married filing separately.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p5">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p6">Their address or the location of their wedding does not matter, as long as the marriage is legal: a same-sex couple who marry in Albany, N.Y., and move to Alabama are treated the same as a same-sex couple who marry and live in Massachusetts.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p6">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p7">“Today’s ruling provides certainty and clear, coherent tax-filing guidance for all legally married same-sex couples nationwide,” Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew said.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p7">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p8">“This ruling also assures legally married same-sex couples that they can move freely throughout the country knowing that their federal filing status will not change.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p8">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p9">Gay and civil rights groups praised the ruling.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p9">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p10">“Committed and loving gay and lesbian married couples will now be treated equally under our nation’s federal tax laws, regardless of what state they call home,” said Chad Griffin, the president of the Human Rights Campaign.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p10">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p11">“These families finally have access to crucial tax benefits and protections previously denied to them under the discriminatory Defense of Marriage Act.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p11">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p12">But the Treasury decision could have ramifications for many gay couples’ tax liabilities, said Roberton Williams of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center in Washington.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p12">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p13">Couples with similar incomes often pay the “marriage penalty,” with their tax liability as a couple being much higher than it would be if they were single.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p13">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p14">At the same time, same-sex couples will also be able to file amended returns for certain prior tax years, meaning that many couples might be eligible for refunds.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p14">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p15">Couples do not have to file amended returns if they do not want to, a senior Treasury official said, meaning that couples who might pay the marriage penalty would not owe back taxes.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p15">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p16">But the ruling creates complications for same-sex couples who live in any of the 37 states that do not recognize their marriages.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p16">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p17">Previously, such couples filed federal and state tax returns as individuals.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p17">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p18">Now, they will have to file their federal returns as other married couples do, but may be required to file their state returns as individuals.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p18">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p19">“There’s going to be a cumbersome workaround,” said Nanette Lee Miller of Marcum L.L.P., a public accounting firm.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p19">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p20">She sees it as a paperwork bother more than a financial issue.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p20">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p21">States might also respond to the federal ruling with changes of their own.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p21">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p22">“Most state income tax regimes begin with federal taxable income as the starting point,” Marvin Kirsner, a tax lawyer at Greenberg Traurig, said in an e-mail.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p22">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p23">“These state taxing authorities will have to figure out how to deal with a same-sex married couple who file a joint income tax return for federal tax purposes.” He added,</span>	<button class="sent" id="p23">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p24">“We will need to see guidance from each nonrecognition state to see how this will be handled.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p24">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p25">The rule change is likely to provide a small increase for federal revenue, as more same-sex couples pay the marriage penalty, Mr. Williams said, describing it as a “rounding error.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p25">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p26">But it would be partly offset by new federal spending on benefits for same-sex spouses.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p26">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p27">The ruling applies to all legal marriages made in the United States or foreign countries.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p27">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p28">But it does not extend to civil unions, registered domestic partnerships or other legal relationships, the Treasury said.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p28">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p29">The Treasury ruling is one of many that are starting to emerge from all corners of the federal government as Washington changes regulations to conform with the Supreme Court decision.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p29">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p30">Separately, the Health and Human Services Department said Thursday that Medicare would extend certain key benefits to same-sex spouses, “clarifying that all beneficiaries in private Medicare plans have access to equal coverage when it comes to care in a nursing home where their spouse lives.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p30">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p31">But federal agencies are not moving in lock step.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p31">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p32">Instead, they are creating a patchwork of regulations affecting gay and lesbian couples — and may be raising questions about discrimination and fairness in the way that federal benefits are distributed.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p32">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p33">Medicare and Treasury officials have said they would use a “place of celebration” standard for determining whether gay couples are eligible for benefits.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p33">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p34">That means same-sex couples would receive benefits as long as they are legally married, regardless of where they live.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p34">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p35">But the Social Security Administration is now using a “place of residence” standard in determining spousal benefits, and a gay couple in Alabama might not receive the same benefits as a gay couple in New York until final determinations are made or Congress acts.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p35">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p36">The Obama administration has pushed federal agencies to ensure the Supreme Court’s ruling is carried out quickly and smoothly.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p36">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p37">“It would be nice if they were consistent,” Ms. Miller said.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p37">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p38">Creating federal regulations is a process and could change, she said.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p38">S</button><br><br>
