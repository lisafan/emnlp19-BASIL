        <i>Title: Mueller Statement Disputes Report That Trump Directed Cohen to Lie</i><br><br>
        <div id="article" onmouseup="annotate()"><span class="para" id="p0">WASHINGTON — The special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election disputed on Friday a report that said President Trump had directed Michael D. Cohen, his longtime lawyer and fixer, to lie to Congress about his role in negotiations to build a skyscraper in Moscow.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p0">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p1">The rare public statement by a spokesman for the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, challenged the facts of an article published by BuzzFeed News on Thursday saying that Mr. Cohen had told prosecutors about being pressured by the president before his congressional testimony.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p1">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p2">“BuzzFeed’s description of specific statements to the special counsel’s office, and characterization of documents and testimony obtained by this office, regarding Michael Cohen’s congressional testimony are not accurate,” said the spokesman, Peter Carr.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p2">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p3">Before Mr. Carr’s statement, the BuzzFeed report led to a flurry of reactions by senior members of Congress who said that the allegations, if true, could be grounds for initiating impeachment proceedings against Mr. Trump.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p3">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p4">The president himself responded on Twitter late Friday, calling the special counsel’s statement “a very sad day for journalism, but a great day for our Country!”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p4">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p5">A proven effort by Mr. Trump to pressure a witness to commit perjury would be one of the most damning revelations so far in the investigation into Russia’s attempts to sabotage the 2016 presidential election and could be the cornerstone of a case that the president obstructed justice to keep investigators at bay.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p5">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p6">Both the White House and lawyers for Mr. Trump vigorously denied the BuzzFeed report even before the special counsel’s office weighed in.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p6">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p7">“Two words sum it up better than anything anybody else can say, and that is ’categorically false,’” the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, told reporters on Friday.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p7">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p8">BuzzFeed News maintained that its report was accurate, its editor, Ben Smith, said after Mr. Mueller’s office disputed the account.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p8">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p9">“We stand by our reporting and the sources who informed it, and we urge the Special Counsel to make clear what he’s disputing,” Mr. Smith said on Twitter.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p9">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p10">The statement by Mr. Carr, the special counsel’s spokesman, was unusual because it appeared to be the first time he had publicly challenged the facts of a news media account that had generated significant attention for its revelations about the president.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p10">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p11">The New York Times has not independently confirmed the BuzzFeed report.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p11">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p12">One person familiar with Mr. Cohen’s testimony to the special counsel’s prosecutors said that Mr. Cohen did not state that the president had pressured him to lie to Congress.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p12">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p13">Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said that his panel would investigate the BuzzFeed report and was “already working to secure additional witness testimony and documents related to the Trump Tower Moscow deal and other investigative matters.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p13">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p14">If true, Mr. Schiff said, the allegations “would constitute both the subornation of perjury as well as obstruction of justice.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p14">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p15">Representative Joaquin Castro of Texas, another Democratic member of the House Intelligence Committee, wrote in a tweet that “if the @BuzzFeed story is true, President Trump must resign or be impeached.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p15">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p16">Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, told reporters on Friday that the panel expected Mr. Cohen to be back to testify privately in early February.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p16">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p17">The report added another jolt to a chaotic week for the White House, which has had to fend off questions about recent revelations that F.B.I. counterintelligence agents began investigating Mr. Trump in 2017 and that Mr. Trump has tried to conceal the details from senior administration officials about his interactions with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p17">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p18">In a December court filing, prosecutors working for Mr. Mueller described how Mr. Cohen had repeatedly lied to Congress both about the length of negotiations over the Trump Tower Moscow deal and about Mr. Trump’s involvement in the project.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p18">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p19">Mr. Cohen had told lawmakers that the negotiations ended in January 2016 — before the first presidential primaries — and were never discussed extensively among executives of the Trump Organization.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p19">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p20">In fact, according to prosecutors, the discussions continued as late as June 2016, after Mr. Trump was the presumptive Republican presidential nominee.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p20">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p21">They also said Mr. Cohen discussed the progress of the Moscow project with Mr. Trump more frequently than he had told the committee and had briefed members of Mr. Trump’s family about the negotiations.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p21">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p22">When he appeared in court to plead guilty to lying to Congress, Mr. Cohen said he had concealed his interactions with Russian officials and the fact that he asked Mr. Trump to travel to Russia to promote the deal because he wanted to support Mr. Trump’s “political messaging.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p22">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p23">That day, Mr. Trump defended his role in the Trump Tower Moscow discussions, brushing aside concerns that he was advancing his business interests at the time he was hoping to become president.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p23">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p24">“There was a good chance that I wouldn’t have won, in which case I would have gotten back into the business, and why should I lose lots of opportunities?” he told reporters.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p24">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p25">Mr. Cohen drafted his statement to Congress in August 2017 along with Steven Ryan, his lawyer at the time, according to people familiar with how the testimony was put together.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p25">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p26">Mr. Ryan was working with lawyers for the Trump family as part of a joint defense agreement.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p26">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p27">At least one of Mr. Trump’s personal lawyers saw Mr. Cohen’s congressional testimony before he delivered it in August and October 2017, according to people with knowledge of the discussions.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p27">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p28">Mr. Cohen initially repeated his false statements about the Moscow tower to prosecutors working for Mr. Mueller after he pleaded guilty in August to campaign finance violations and financial crimes.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p28">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p29">But he corrected himself during subsequent interviews and proved credible, the special counsel’s office said in a December sentencing memo.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p29">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p30">Mr. Cohen said he initially lied because he did not want to contradict his congressional testimony, prosecutors said.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p30">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p31">Subsequently, he took care “not to overstate his knowledge or the role of others in the conduct under investigation” and provided “useful information” about his contacts with “persons connected to the White House” in 2017 and 2018, the special counsel’s filing said.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p31">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p32">That truthfulness was a departure from Mr. Cohen’s pattern of deception throughout his professional life, according to a separate sentencing memo by federal prosecutors in New York, filed at the same time as Mr. Mueller’s.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p32">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p33">Driven by greed, they said, he “repeatedly used his power and influence for deceptive ends.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p33">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p34">Mr. Cohen was sentenced in December to three years in prison for lying to Congress, campaign finance violations and financial crimes.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p34">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p35">He said he took full responsibility for his crimes, but said he acted out of blind loyalty to Mr. Trump, who he said “led me to choose a path of darkness over light.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p35">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p36">During his nomination hearing this week to become attorney general, William P. Barr was asked if the president would have committed a crime if he had coached a witness to testify falsely — or not to testify at all.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p36">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p37">“Yes,” Mr. Barr said. “Under an obstruction statute, yes.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p37">S</button><br><br>
