        <i>Title: Pipe Bomb Suspect Arrested in Southern Florida</i><br><br>
        <div id="article" onmouseup="annotate()"><span class="para" id="p0">Federal authorities made an arrest on Friday in connection with the nationwide bombing campaign against outspoken critics of President Trump, a significant breakthrough in a case that has gripped the country in the days leading up to the midterm elections.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p0">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p1">A law enforcement official identified the suspect as Cesar Sayoc Jr., 56, of Aventura, Fla., just north of Miami.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p1">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p2">Mr. Sayoc, a registered Republican, has a lengthy criminal history in Florida dating back to 1991 that includes felony theft, drug and fraud charges, as well as being arrested and accused of threatening to use a bomb, public records show.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p2">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p3">His criminal record from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement indicates that at the time of his last arrest in 2015, he was 5-foot-11 and 215 pounds.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p3">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p4">He has brown eyes, black hair and a scar on his left arm, the records said, and was born in New York.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p4">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p5">The records listed Mr. Sayoc’s occupation as “manager.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p5">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p6">According to a 2012 bankruptcy petition filed in Miami, Mr. Sayoc resided at the time at his mother’s home.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p6">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p7">“Lives w/mom,” a handwritten note on the petition said.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p7">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p8">“Has no furniture.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p8">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p9">On Friday morning, the authorities surrounded a white van with pro-Trump stickers on it, and television news later showed images of the authorities hauling the van away on a truck underneath a tarp.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p9">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p10">But it remained unclear if the van belonged to Mr. Sayoc.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p10">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p11">Some residents of Aventura reported seeing a similar white van covered in pro-Trump stickers often parked in the lot of a local strip mall, the Aventura Waterways shopping center.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p11">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p12">But it was not immediately clear if that van was the same one seized by the police on Friday.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p12">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p13">“It struck me because of the crazy conspiratorial stickers covering the windows,” said David Cypkin, a documentary film producer and editor with the Rakontur production company.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p13">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p14">“It was unsettling, and also it seemed to be occupied.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p14">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p15">Sometimes the door would be ajar or a window would be open, which indicated to me that maybe somebody was living in the van.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p15">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p16">Speaking at the White House on Friday, Mr. Trump praised law enforcement officials for quickly arresting a suspect.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p16">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p17">“These terrorizing acts are despicable and have no place in our country,” he said.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p17">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p18">He added: “We must never allow political violence to take root in America.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p18">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p19">Mr. Sayoc’s arrest came only hours after the mysterious spate of pipe bombs spread further as federal authorities said on Friday morning that they had found two more of the explosive devices: one addressed to Senator Cory Booker and the other to James R. Clapper Jr., the former director of national intelligence.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p19">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p20">Although no formal charges have been filed yet in the case, two of the law enforcement officials said there was a high likelihood that Mr. Sayoc would be prosecuted at least in part in Federal District Court in Manhattan.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p20">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p21">The F.B.I.’s New York office has been leading the investigation and five of the bombs sent this week fall under the jurisdiction of the United States attorney’s office in Manhattan.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p21">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p22">The package addressed to Mr. Clapper was meant to be delivered to the New York offices of CNN, where he works as an analyst, but was intercepted at a mail facility in Midtown Manhattan, police officials in New York City said.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p22">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p23">The package addressed to Mr. Booker, a New Jersey Democrat, was found in Florida, which two people briefed on the matter have said has become a focus of the intense, nationwide investigation into the bombs.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p23">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p24">At a news conference on Friday morning, John Miller, the New York Police Department’s deputy commissioner of intelligence and counterterrorism, said a postal worker at the mail facility on 52nd Street recognized the package addressed to Mr. Clapper as similar to other suspicious packages discovered this week and “froze it in the system.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p24">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p25">The department’s bomb squad responded to the facility and secured the package for delivery to an F.B.I. lab in Quantico, Va., Mr. Miller said.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p25">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p26">Speaking on CNN on Friday, Mr. Clapper said he was not surprised that a device had been sent to him.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p26">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p27">He has been a frequent critic of President Trump, a similarity shared with everyone whose names have appeared on the packages discovered so far.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p27">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p28">“This is definitely domestic terrorism,” Mr. Clapper said.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p28">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p29">“Anyone who has in any way been a critic, publicly been a critic of President Trump, needs to be on an extra alert.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p29">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p30">Mr. Clapper also said that on Wednesday night he had taken precautions after the first packages were discovered.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p30">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p31">While he and his wife were away from their home this week, he added, he told his neighbor not to collect their mail.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p31">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p32">All together, 12 crude explosive devices have been found since Monday, sent through the mail to a host of Democrats and other prominent figures who have been among Mr. Trump’s most vocal detractors.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p32">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p33">The packages — virtually identical in plain manila envelopes — have been addressed to former President Barack Obama; former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.; former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton; Representative Maxine Waters of California; former Attorney General Eric Holder; John O. Brennan, a former C.I.A. director, the actor Robert De Niro; and George Soros, the billionaire Democratic donor.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p33">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p34">All of the envelopes had return address labels bearing the misspelled name of Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Democrat whose district is in southern Florida.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p34">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p35">None of the devices inside have exploded on their own so far, and investigators are still seeking to determine whether they were even capable of detonating.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p35">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p36">But the authorities in New York and elsewhere have warned that the devices should be considered dangerous.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p36">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p37">The first package was discovered on Monday afternoon at the suburban New York home of Mr. Soros.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p37">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p38">While investigators initially thought that some devices were hand delivered, they now believe it is likely all of them were sent in the mail.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p38">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p39">Using information collected by the United States Postal Service, investigators have focused their attention on certain Florida postal centers, including one in Opa-locka near Miami.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p39">S</button><br><br>
