        <i>Title: After Nightclub Massacre, Obama Expresses Outrage and a Familiar Lament</i><br><br>
        <div id="article" onmouseup="annotate()"><span class="para" id="p0">WASHINGTON — The tableau at the White House was chillingly familiar: The somber president, nearing the end of his eight-year term, walked grim-faced to the podium to offer his condolences, promised action in the wake of suffering and pleaded for a new resolve that just might prevent more deaths in a hail of bullets.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p0">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p1">The list of tragedies on President Obama’s watch seems countless by now.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p1">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p2">An elementary classroom. A church. A military base. A movie theater. And, now, a gay nightclub.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p2">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p3">Mr. Obama said Sunday’s massacre, by a gunman with a handgun and an assault weapon, is another brutal reminder of how easy it is for someone to slaughter dozens.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p3">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p4">“We have to decide if that’s the kind of country we want to be,” Mr. Obama said on Sunday as he mourned the nation’s deadliest mass shooting.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p4">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p5">“And to actively do nothing is a decision, as well.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p5">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p6">Mr. Obama vowed to respond forcefully to what he called a devastating “act of terror and an act of hate.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p6">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p7">This time, it was a tragedy that combined gun violence, a hatred of gays and ties to Islamist terrorism.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p7">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p8">In his remarks, Mr. Obama said it was still unclear to the authorities whether there was a direct link between the gunman and international terrorist groups.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p8">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p9">But in the hours after he spoke, law enforcement officials said that the gunman had pledged his allegiance to the Islamic State, and they acknowledged that he had twice been investigated for terrorism connections.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p9">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p10">It took only hours for questions about those connections to become fodder in the presidential campaign.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p10">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p11">Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, seized on the attacks as evidence of America’s weakness in facing terrorism.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p11">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p12">He demanded that Mr. Obama resign because he refused to say the words “radical Islam” in his remarks.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p12">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p13">“If we do not get tough and smart real fast, we are not going to have a country anymore,” Mr. Trump said in a statement.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p13">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p14">“Because our leaders are weak, I said this was going to happen — and it is only going to get worse.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p14">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p15">I am trying to save lives and prevent the next terrorist attack.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p15">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p16">Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, called the massacre in Orlando, Fla., an “act of terror” and an “act of hate” and called for “hardening our defenses at home” while “refusing to be intimidated and staying true to our values” in the United States.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p16">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p17">Mr. Obama pleaded with Americans during his remarks not to “give in to fear or turn against each other,” a somewhat muted reference to Mr. Trump’s previous call for a ban on Muslims entering the United States.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p17">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p18">“In the face of hate and violence, we will love one another,” Mr. Obama said.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p18">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p19">Rather than giving in to fear, the president said, “we will stand united, as Americans, to protect our people, and defend our nation, and to take action against those who threaten us.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p19">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p20">Speaking to reporters, Mr. Obama said the country had again been traumatized by grievous violence, which shattered more than 100 lives during a three-hour nightmare early Sunday, with 50 people killed and 53 wounded in the attack.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p20">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p21">During his presidency, Mr. Obama has repeatedly mourned victims of mass shootings, often expressing anger and frustration at what he has said is the country’s apparent willingness to let them become a “normal” part of life.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p21">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p22">That anger has been compounded by Mr. Obama’s inability to persuade lawmakers to impose new restrictions on the availability of firearms, especially the assault-style rifles like the one believed to have been used by the gunman in Sunday morning’s attack in Orlando.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p22">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p23">A major push for a ban on assault weapons after the 2012 massacre of schoolchildren in Newtown, Conn., ended in failure.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p23">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p24">“Can we say that we’re truly doing enough to give all the children of this country the chance they deserve to live out their lives in happiness and with purpose?” an emotional Mr. Obama said after the Newtown attack.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p24">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p25">Mr. Obama on Sunday gave his deepest condolences to the families of the victims, and he said Americans should, in particular, keep the country’s gay and lesbian community in mind as they offer their prayers.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p25">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p26">He called it an “especially heartbreaking day” for the gay community.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p26">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p27">“The shooter targeted a nightclub where people came together to be with friends, to dance and to sing, and to live,” Mr. Obama said.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p27">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p28">“The place where they were attacked is more than a nightclub — it is a place of solidarity and empowerment where people have come together to raise awareness, to speak their minds and to advocate for their civil rights.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p28">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p29">Mr. Obama has often hailed the progress on gay rights that has been made during his presidency, especially the decision by the United States Supreme Court to allow same-sex marriage.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p29">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p30">But those legal protections have not erased hatred in the country.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p30">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p31">“This is a sobering reminder that attacks on any American — regardless of race, ethnicity, religion or sexual orientation — is an attack on all of us and on the fundamental values of equality and dignity that define us as a country,” he said.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p31">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p32">Mr. Obama took no questions from reporters after delivering his five-minute remarks.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p32">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p33">He turned from the podium to walk back into the West Wing, once again left to monitor the investigation, prepare a likely eulogy for the dead and wonder when he might have to come into the briefing room again.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p33">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p34">Shortly after he spoke, Mr. Obama ordered that flags at the White House and other federal sites around the world be lowered to half-staff. Again.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p34">S</button><br><br>
