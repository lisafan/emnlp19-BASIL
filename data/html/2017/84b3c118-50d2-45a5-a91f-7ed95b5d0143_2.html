        <i>Title: Donald Trump Is Sworn In as President, Capping His Swift Ascent</i><br><br>
        <div id="article" onmouseup="annotate()"><span class="para" id="p0">WASHINGTON — Donald John Trump was inaugurated as the 45th president of the United States on Friday, ushering in a new era that he vowed would shatter the established order and reverse a national decline that he called “this American carnage.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p0">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p1">In a ceremony that capped a remarkable rise to power, Mr. Trump presented himself as the leader of a populist uprising to restore lost greatness.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p1">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p2">He outlined a dark vision of an America afflicted by “the ravages” of economic dislocation and foreign exploitation, requiring his can-do approach to turn around.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p2">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p3">“I will fight for you with every breath in my body, and I will never, ever let you down,” Mr. Trump told hundreds of thousands of rain-soaked admirers and onlookers in a forceful 16-minute Inaugural Address from the West Front of the Capitol.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p3">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p4">“America will start winning again, winning like never before.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p4">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p5">We will bring back our jobs. We will bring back our borders. We will bring back our wealth. And we will bring back our dreams.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p5">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p6">Mr. Trump’s ascension amounted to a hostile takeover of a capital facing its most significant disruption in generations.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p6">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p7">While officially a Republican, he has taken on leaders of both parties and, with no prior political career of his own, made clear that he saw himself as the ultimate outsider not beholden to the current system.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p7">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p8">“We will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action, constantly complaining but never doing anything about it,” he said.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p8">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p9">“The time for empty talk is over. Now arrives the hour of action.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p9">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p10">Do not allow anyone to tell you that it cannot be done.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p10">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p11">Mr. Trump’s view of the United States was strikingly grim for an Inaugural Address — a country where mothers and children are “trapped in poverty in our inner cities,” where “rusted-out factories” are “scattered like tombstones across the landscape” and where drugs and crime “have stolen too many lives.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p11">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p12">“This American carnage,” he declared, “stops right here and stops right now.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p12">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p13">He got started right away with rolling back the policies of his predecessor, former President Barack Obama, by issuing orders freezing new regulations from recent weeks and ordering agencies to “ease the burden” of the Affordable Care Act during the transition from repealing to replacing the law.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p13">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p14">More orders are planned for next week.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p14">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p15">Wearing a dark suit and red tie and accompanied by his wife, Melania, in a powder-blue suit and matching gloves, Mr. Trump took the 35-word oath administered by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. precisely at noon.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p15">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p16">Michael Richard Pence, a former governor and congressman from Indiana, was sworn in minutes before as vice president by Justice Clarence Thomas.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p16">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p17">Mr. Trump assumed the presidency of a country still unsettled after a polarizing election and entered office with less support in polls than any other president in recent history.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p17">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p18">It was clear from the day that there would be no grace period either for or by the new president.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p18">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p19">The Senate confirmed two cabinet nominations — James N. Mattis as defense secretary and John F. Kelly as secretary of homeland security — but Democrats temporarily held up Mike Pompeo’s confirmation as C.I.A. director.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p19">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p20">Throughout the day, there were mostly peaceful protests against the new president.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p20">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p21">Sporadic violence broke out as demonstrators smashed shop windows and burned a limousine, while police officers in riot helmets responded with tear gas.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p21">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p22">More than 200 people were arrested.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p22">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p23">Liberal groups prepared for a women’s march on Saturday that they said could draw hundreds of thousands.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p23">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p24">Mr. Trump made only passing efforts to reach out to Democrats beyond thanking Mr. Obama and his wife, Michelle, for their handling of the transition.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p24">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p25">“They have been magnificent,” he said in his speech.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p25">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p26">He later praised his defeated opponent, Hillary Clinton, at a lobster-and-beef luncheon with congressional leaders, asking her and former President Bill Clinton to stand for applause.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p26">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p27">“I have a lot of respect for these two people,” he said.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p27">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p28">Democrats were not impressed.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p28">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p29">“I was pretty shocked by how dark it was,” Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, said of Mr. Trump’s Inaugural Address.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p29">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p30">“I love this country, and I don’t understand how a president of the United States that loves his country could paint a picture of its failures.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p30">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p31">He added, “It was interesting sitting up onstage with a bunch of billionaires hearing him say how bad the country was.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p31">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p32">The National Mall was filled with supporters, many wearing “Make America Great Again” hats and chanting “Trump! Trump! Trump!”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p32">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p33">But the lingering animosity from the presidential campaign was on display, too.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p33">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p34">When Mrs. Clinton arrived, some in the crowd chanted, “Lock her up,” mimicking Mr. Trump’s campaign rallies.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p34">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p35">As he took the oath, a cluster of people blew whistles and screamed, “Not my president,” before being escorted out.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p35">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p36">While large, the crowds on a soggy day did not rival the energetic throngs at Mr. Obama’s first inauguration eight years ago, according to aerial photographs.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p36">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p37">The Washington Metrorail system recorded fewer than half as many rides on Friday morning as in 2009, and knots of bystanders along the inaugural parade route were not as thick.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p37">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p38">In a city that gave just 4 percent of its vote to Mr. Trump, many residents left town and about 60 House Democrats boycotted the event.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p38">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p39">Mr. Obama made his exit after the ceremony, flying by helicopter to Joint Base Andrews in the Maryland suburbs, where he thanked former aides and members of his administration before boarding the presidential jet, no longer designated Air Force One, to fly to Palm Springs, Calif., for vacation.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p39">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p40">He will return to Washington to a rental house while his daughter Sasha finishes high school, the first president to stay in the capital since Woodrow Wilson.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p40">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p41">Hours before his departure, Mr. Obama posted on Twitter to thank followers and hint that he would not fade away.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p41">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p42">“I won’t stop,” he said.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p42">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p43">“I’ll be right there with you as a citizen, inspired by your voices of truth and justice, good humor, and love.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p43">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p44">Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his wife, Jill, rode an Amtrak train to Delaware and the home they have there.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p44">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p45">But they, too, planned to return, at least part time, to Washington, where Mrs. Biden teaches at a community college in the Virginia suburbs.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p45">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p46">The United States has never seen a president quite like Mr. Trump, the son and grandson of immigrants who grew up to become a real estate magnate, casino owner, beauty pageant operator and reality television star whose tumultuous love life played out in the tabloids.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p46">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p47">Never has the oath been administered to a president who had never served either in public office or as a general in the military.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p47">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p48">At age 70, Mr. Trump became the oldest president sworn in for the first time and the first born in New York since Franklin D. Roosevelt.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p48">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p49">He was also one of the wealthiest presidents ever to enter the White House, with far-reaching business connections that have already raised questions about where his interests end and the country’s begin.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p49">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p50">He arrived in the Oval Office dogged by reports about Russian interference in the election on his behalf.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p50">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p51">But Mr. Trump overcame skeptics when he embarked on what seemed like a quixotic bid for the presidency.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p51">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p52">An Ivy League-educated mogul who lives in a New York tower named after himself with an 80-foot-long living room, he transformed himself into the unlikely leader of a working-class movement anchored in rural areas far removed from the coasts.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p52">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p53">His bracing candor, disregard for convention and willingness to offend whole sections of the population to make a point came across as refreshing truth-telling to many Americans disenchanted with Washington elites.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p53">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p54">For the nation’s 58th inauguration, though, the untraditional president opted to follow tradition.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p54">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p55">He and Mrs. Trump, a former model from Slovenia who became the first foreign-born first lady since John Quincy Adams’s wife, Louisa, started the day with a service at St. John’s Episcopal Church adjacent to Lafayette Square, then joined the Obamas, Bidens and Pences for coffee at the White House.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p55">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p56">From there, the two presidents shared a limousine to the Capitol, where three other presidents waited: Mr. Clinton, Jimmy Carter and George W. Bush, all of whom opposed Mr. Trump’s election.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p56">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p57">Former President George Bush remained hospitalized in Houston, recovering from pneumonia, but a spokesman said he watched the ceremony on television.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p57">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p58">Mr. Pence, 57, was sworn in at 11:54 a.m., placing his hand on Ronald Reagan’s Bible, which was held by his wife, Karen, as their three adult children, Michael, Charlotte and Audrey, watched.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p58">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p59">For his oath, Mr. Trump placed his hand on two Bibles held by his wife, one given him by his mother in 1955 just before his ninth birthday and another used by Abraham Lincoln in 1861 and again by Mr. Obama in 2009 and 2013.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p59">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p60">Standing nearby were his adult children from two previous marriages, Donald Jr., Eric, Ivanka and Tiffany.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p60">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p61">Also there was Barron, his 10-year-old son with the first lady.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p61">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p62">Joining them was Ivanka’s husband, Jared Kushner, who will serve as an unpaid senior adviser.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p62">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p63">As Mr. Trump approached the podium, rain began to fall.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p63">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p64">It was not a conventionally Republican speech, with nothing about tax cuts or restraining government.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p64">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p65">Instead, he laid out a protectionist agenda, saying his rule will be “buy American and hire American.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p65">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p66">He did pledge to “eradicate from the face of the Earth” Islamic terrorism.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p66">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p67">Responding to charges that he demonized Mexicans and Muslims, Mr. Trump said, “There is no room for prejudice.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p67">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p68">Mr. Trump said the inauguration was not merely the transfer of power from one president to another.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p68">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p69">“We are transferring power from Washington, D.C., and giving it back to you, the people,” he said.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p69">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p70">“For too long,” he continued, “a small group in our nation’s capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p70">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p71">Washington flourished but the people did not share in the wealth.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p71">S</button><br><br>
