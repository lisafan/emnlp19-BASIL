        <i>Title: Hillary Clinton Asks State Department to Vet Emails for Release</i><br><br>
        <div id="article" onmouseup="annotate()"><span class="para" id="p0">WASHINGTON — As State Department lawyers sifted last summer through a new batch of documents related to the Benghazi attacks, they repeatedly saw something that caught their attention: emails sent to and from a personal account for Hillary Rodham Clinton.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p0">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p1">The lawyers, according to current and former State Department officials, were working to respond to a request from a specially appointed House committee investigating the 2012 attacks in Libya.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p1">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p2">But they noticed that among the 15,000 documents they examined, there were no emails to or from an official departmental account for Mrs. Clinton.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p2">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p3">“This all raised the question to us: What else are we missing, and what do we need to comply” with the request, said one official briefed on the matter.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p3">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p4">Mrs. Clinton’s spokesman and the State Department have cast her decision to hand over her emails as motivated by efforts to update the department’s record management system.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p4">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p5">“When the department asked former secretaries last year for help ensuring their emails were in fact retained, we immediately said yes,” Nick Merrill, the Clinton spokesman, said on Sunday.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p5">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p6">But it was the review of Benghazi-related documents last summer that, within the State Department, set off the chain of events leading to the public disclosure this week of Mrs. Clinton’s use of a private email account, according to the current and former department officials.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p6">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p7">The decision to ask Mrs. Clinton for her emails went all the way to Secretary of State John Kerry’s chief of staff, who, along with officials working on the response to the Benghazi requests, signed off on it.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p7">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p8">Beginning in August, senior State Department officials held negotiations with Mrs. Clinton’s lawyers and advisers to gain access to her personal email records.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p8">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p9">At one point, her advisers met face-to-face with department officials in Washington.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p9">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p10">In October, the State Department sent a letter to Mrs. Clinton and all former secretaries of state back to Madeleine K. Albright, seeking emails and other documents in their possession that related to their government work.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p10">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p11">Finally, in December, dozens of boxes filled with 50,000 pages of printed emails from Mrs. Clinton’s personal account were delivered to the State Department.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p11">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p12">Those documents were then examined by department lawyers, who found roughly 900 pages pertaining to the Benghazi attacks.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p12">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p13">Three weeks ago, the State Department handed over the Benghazi emails to the House Select Committee on Benghazi, which is led by Representative Trey Gowdy, Republican of South Carolina.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p13">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p14">Mrs. Clinton’s spokesman, Mr. Merrill, did not respond to an email seeking comment.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p14">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p15">A senior State Department official said, “It would be oversimplified and inaccurate to draw the conclusion that the preservation of her records was done for one purpose.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p15">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p16">Late Wednesday night, two days after The New York Times first reported that she had exclusively used a personal email account as secretary of state, Mrs. Clinton announced that she had asked the State Department to release those communications.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p16">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p17">“I want the public to see my email,” Mrs. Clinton wrote in a Twitter post shortly before midnight, addressing the issue publicly for the first time.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p17">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p18">“I asked State to release them.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p18">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p19">They said they will review them for release as soon as possible.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p19">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p20">Mrs. Clinton’s decision leaves it to the State Department to determine whether parts of her correspondence should be redacted if they contain information that could be damaging to national security, or for other reasons.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p20">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p21">That process could take several months, officials said, because different parts of the State Department must weigh in on whether information should be redacted.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p21">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p22">Other government agencies, like the C.I.A. and the Defense Department, may also need to be consulted on any information related to them.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p22">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p23">While the State Department has said there does not appear to be any classified material in Mrs. Clinton’s emails, officials said on Thursday that they needed to go through the trove again to determine whether it contained any “sensitive” information.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p23">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p24">Sensitive information is different from classified information.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p24">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p25">It can be personal data, like Social Security numbers, or information on matters that other countries consider classified or important to their national security.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p25">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p26">One State Department official said that if many lawyers were dedicated to the project, it could be completed in several weeks.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p26">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p27">Since the disclosure that Mrs. Clinton used the private account, a spokeswoman for the State Department has described the request from Mrs. Clinton as part of the department’s larger efforts to improve its record-keeping.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p27">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p28">The spokeswoman, Marie Harf, was asked on Tuesday whether there was any connection between the requests from Congress and the decision to ask the former secretaries of state for emails from their personal accounts.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p28">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p29">“The letter actually went before we got the request from the select committee,” Ms. Harf said of the request to the former secretaries.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p29">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p30">“It went in October of 2014 — that was before we had gotten a request from the committee — as part of our records-maintenance upgrading and the process we go through.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p30">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p31">Ms. Harf said that Mrs. Clinton was the only secretary of state who had sent back copies of emails.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p31">S</button><br><br>
