        <i>Title: White House Used Bill Clinton to Ask Sestak to Drop Out of Race</i><br><br>
        <div id="article" onmouseup="annotate()"><span class="para" id="p0">President Obama’s chief of staff used former President Bill Clinton as an intermediary to see if Representative Joe Sestak would drop out of Pennsylvania’s Democratic Senate primary if given a prominent, but unpaid, advisory position, the White House said on Friday.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p0">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p1">Rahm Emanuel, the chief of staff, asked Mr. Clinton last summer to explore “options of service” on a presidential or senior government advisory board with Mr. Sestak, the White House said in a statement.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p1">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p2">Mr. Sestak said no and went on to win last week’s primary against Senator Arlen Specter.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p2">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p3">The White House disputed Republican claims that the conversations might be illegal or improper.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p3">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p4">“There was no such impropriety,” Robert F. Bauer, the White House counsel, said in a memo released to reporters.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p4">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p5">“The Democratic Party leadership had a legitimate interest in averting a divisive primary fight and a similarly legitimate concern about the congressman vacating his seat in the House.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p5">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p6">Mr. Bauer went on to say that such horse-trading has been commonplace through history.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p6">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p7">“There have been numerous, reported instances in the past when prior administrations – both Democratic and Republican, and motivated by the same goals – discussed alternative paths to service for qualified individuals also considering campaigns for public office,” he wrote.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p7">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p8">“Such discussions are fully consistent with the relevant law and ethical requirements.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p8">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p9">Representative Darrell Issa of California, the senior Republican on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said the interactions described by the White House “represent an illegal quid pro quo,” even if the position was unpaid.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p9">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p10">“It is abundantly clear that this kind of conduct is contrary to President Obama’s pledge to change ’business as usual’ and that his administration has engaged in the kind of political shenanigans he once campaigned to end.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p10">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p11">Federal law makes it a crime for anyone “who directly or indirectly, promises any employment, position, compensation, contract, appointment, or any other benefit” to someone else “as consideration, favor, or reward for any political activity or for the support of or opposition to any candidate or any political party in connection with any general or special election to any political office.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p11">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p12">It is also illegal for a government official to use “his official authority for the purpose of interfering with, or affecting, the nomination or the election of any candidate” for Senate.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p12">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p13">While many have speculated that the White House offered to appoint Mr. Sestak as secretary of the Navy, Mr. Bauer said that was never the case.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p13">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p14">The White House did not offer Mr. Sestak a full-time paid position because Mr. Emanuel wanted him to stay in the House rather than risk losing his seat, so he considered “uncompensated advisory board options.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p14">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p15">The White House did not disclose what those options were, but people briefed on the matter said one option was an appointment to the president’s Intelligence Advisory Board, a panel of prominent Americans outside government who provide independent oversight of the nation’s spy apparatus and advise the president.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p15">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p16">But White House officials discovered that it would not work because Mr. Sestak could not serve on the board while still serving in Congress.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p16">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p17">In a statement Friday, Mr. Sestak said Mr. Clinton had conveyed Mr. Emanuel’s suggestion that he join a “presidential board” while remaining in the House, but he declined.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p17">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p18">“I told President Clinton that my only consideration in getting into the Senate race or not was whether it was the right thing to do for Pennsylvania working families and not any offer,” Mr. Sestak said.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p18">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p19">“The former president said he knew I’d say that, and the conversation moved on to other subjects.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p19">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p20">Mr. Sestak first mentioned publicly in February that he had been offered a job but provided no details, and the White House for three months had refused to discuss it, generating intense criticism from Republicans who accused it of trying to bribe a congressman and deep consternation among Democrats who called on the administration to answer questions.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p20">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p21">Mr. Emanuel was eager last summer to clear the way to this year’s Democratic Senate nomination for Mr. Specter, who had just left the Republican party, and to bolster Democrats’ majority in the Senate.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p21">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p22">Mr. Sestak, a retired admiral and two-term House member, was already planning a run.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p22">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p23">In tapping Mr. Clinton as the go-between, Mr. Emanuel picked the party’s most prominent figure other than Mr. Obama and someone Mr. Sestak had worked for on the National Security Council in the 1990s.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p23">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p24">Mr. Sestak endorsed Hillary Rodham Clinton against Mr. Obama in the 2008 presidential primaries, and Mr. Clinton was one of the first to call to congratulate him on his Senate victory last week.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p24">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p25">Mr. Clinton was at the White House on Thursday to have lunch with Mr. Obama and join him in greeting the American men’s World Cup soccer team heading to South Africa.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p25">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p26">As chief of staff and previously as chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Mr. Emanuel has not been shy about trying to steer party nominations to those he considers the stronger candidates.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p26">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p27">The White House under Mr. Emanuel has also leaned on Gov. David Paterson of New York to drop out of this year’s gubernatorial race, which he eventually did under a cloud of scandal.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p27">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p28">Mr. Emanuel’s deputy, Jim Messina, suggested a possible administration job to Andrew Romanoff to get him to not challenge Sen. Michael Bennet in a Colorado primary, The Denver Post has reported, citing unnamed sources.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p28">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p29">Whether that constitutes ordinary political horse-trading or crosses a legal line has been debated in Washington for months.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p29">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p30">Democrats and some Republicans have said it is hardly unusual for presidents to offer political appointments to clear the way for allies.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p30">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p31">But Republicans have suggested such actions may constitute a crime.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p31">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p32">Mr. Issa and all seven Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee have asked the Justice Department to appoint a special prosecutor.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p32">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p33">The Justice Department wrote Mr. Issa last week that it did not need a special prosecutor to investigate if it chose to do so.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p33">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p34">Government officials, who asked not to be identified discussing legal decisions, said that neither the Justice Department nor the Office of Special Counsel, an agency that looks at violations of the Hatch Act governing the political conduct of federal employees, is investigating.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p34">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p35">While declining to discuss what happened, Mr. Obama on Thursday said, “I can assure the public that nothing improper took place.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p35">S</button><br><br>
