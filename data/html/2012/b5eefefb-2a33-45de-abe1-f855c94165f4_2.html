        <i>Title: Biden-Ryan Debate: All About Joe</i><br><br>
        <div id="article" onmouseup="annotate()"><span class="para" id="p0">DANVILLE, Ky. –- Joe Biden did everything President Barack Obama did not last week, and a good bit more.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p0">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p1">The vice president dominated the spotlight in the only debate between himself and Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), charging at Republican Mitt Romney's running mate from the get-go and bombarding him with a flurry of eye rolls, interjections and accusations.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p1">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p2">What it accomplished among undecided voters, if anything, is hard to tell and will take days to sort out.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p2">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p3">Two instant surveys of Americans watching the debate -- one by CBS, one by CNN -- showed mixed results.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p3">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p4">But since vice presidential debates often have a negligible impact on the overall race anyway, Biden's sometimes over-the-top performance probably accomplished what he appeared intent on doing: rallying the Democratic base after Obama's woeful debate performance last week.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p4">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p5">Obama, at least, was cheered by the offensive.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p5">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p6">"I'm going to make a special point of saying that I thought Joe Biden was terrific tonight," the president told reporters after stepping off Air Force One at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland, on his way back to the White House after a day of campaigning in Florida.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p6">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p7">Biden looked as if he could barely stay in his seat for much of the night, interrupting Ryan repeatedly and sometimes making it difficult for the GOP nominee to get out his answers.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p7">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p8">“He had his Red Bull. He certainly had his caffeine,” Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) said after the debate.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p8">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p9">It was a performance by the vice president guaranteed to amp up -– and buck up -– worried Democrats, who had fallen into a paralysis of anxiety after the president's debate.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p9">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p10">No one represented that Democratic angst more than blogger Andrew Sullivan, a supporter of the president.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p10">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p11">Obama adviser David Axelrod said "Andrew is a unique thinker, and I can't speak for how he might react to this.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p11">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p12">I hope he is [reassured]," Axelrod said, adding that he had "high regard for [Sullivan] by the way."</span>	<button class="sent" id="p12">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p13">Sullivan, for the record, called the night "a solid win for Biden" and called Ryan "competent."</span>	<button class="sent" id="p13">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p14">The Obama campaign team, in the spin room after the debate, focused on repeating the theme that, as Axelrod said, Biden showed "passion" and that he showed "a great concern for the middle class."</span>	<button class="sent" id="p14">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p15">Passion was the thing Obama lacked last week, and Romney surprised the president and Democrats by talking constantly about how his policies would help the middle class.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p15">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p16">By contrast, Romney operatives in the spin room said Ryan clearly won on substance and composure while Biden devolved into fits of laughter and audible groans.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p16">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p17">“I think the way the vice president handled himself was condescending,” said Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah).</span>	<button class="sent" id="p17">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p18">“He was constantly interrupting and trying to talk over people.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p18">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p19">When my 11-year-old tries to do that at the dinner table, it’s not tolerated.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p19">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p20">Democrats were intent Thursday night to steal back any edge Romney might have deprived them of in being the party who can appeal to working class and blue-collar voters, and to any voter who considers themselves middle class, which is a large number.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p20">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p21">"These guys discovered the phrase 'middle class' during the last six months on the campaign trail," said Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), who has sparred with Ryan on the House Budget Committee for years and who played Ryan in debate preparation with Biden.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p21">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p22">Though it was Biden at the center of attention and who made it hard for Ryan to get in a word edgewise at times, the 42-year-old kept his composure for much of the night and got in some well-aimed shots at the vice president, who at 69 is his senior by 27 years.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p22">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p23">Ryan seemed focused more on winning over moderate and independent voters who are still making up their minds, less than a month before the election.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p23">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p24">The night's 90-minute debate, the only one for the two vice presidential candidates, fluctuated between domestic policy and foreign policy, with ABC's Martha Raddatz, a reporter with vast foreign policy experience, asking numerous questions about events overseas.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p24">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p25">But the number one goal for Biden all night was obvious from the outset: push back. Hard.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p25">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p26">It was the number one thing that Democrats had said Obama should have done last week, and it foreshadowed how the president will approach next Tuesday's debate with Romney, the second of three debates for the two men running for president.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p26">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p27">After Ryan finished his opening statement, responding to a question about the death of the U.S. ambassador to Libya in a terrorist attack in Benghazi a month ago, Biden responded: "That's a bunch of malarkey."</span>	<button class="sent" id="p27">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p28">"Not a single thing he said is accurate," Biden said.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p28">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p29">At times, Biden repeatedly butted in on Ryan's answers, refusing to let Ryan finish his thought.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p29">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p30">If it were anyone other than Biden, who is treated by the press as a lovable, half-crazy uncle, he would have been labeled insufferable.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p30">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p31">Instead, he got the aggressive label.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p31">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p32">Republicans thought it was much more than that.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p32">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p33">Republican National Committee spokesman Tim Miller called Biden “unhinged.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p33">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p34">Romney adviser Eric Fehrnstrom tweeted: “Ryan: serious, sober, steady.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p34">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p35">Biden: smirking, mocking, immature.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p35">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p36">Some of the more experienced Republicans tried to resist talking about Biden’s behavior, knowing it would come across as complaining.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p36">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p37">“Most people probably found the vice president’s performance a little -- well anyway, I think that people will judge for themselves,” said Ed Gillespie, one of the top advisers to Romney and one of the most seasoned Republican operatives in politics.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p37">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p38">But not even Gillespie, when he was asked by a reporter where he was going before he cut himself off, could resist getting some digs at Biden.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p38">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p39">“I don't know if his staff didn't brief him or not, but somebody should have told him that these debates are split-screen,” Gillespie said.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p39">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p40">“There seemed to be some frustration on his part at times, and sometimes I got the impression that he couldn't defend the facts as they were, [so] raise your voice a little louder,” Gillespie said.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p40">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p41">The Obama campaign, of course, relished in Republicans’ focus on Biden’s behavior instead of the substance of his remarks.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p41">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p42">"Their side is all spending their time talking about laughing and facial tics," said Obama campaign manager Jim Messina.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p42">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p43">"You're going to do that when you've lost a debate.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p43">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p44">And that's what happened tonight: they lost the debate."</span>	<button class="sent" id="p44">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p45">Of course, Biden was so demonstrative, so outsized, that it was hard to talk about anything else.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p45">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p46">Biden did another thing Obama did not a week ago.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p46">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p47">He raised the issue of Romney’s comments at a fundraiser in May in which he talked disparagingly about people who receive government benefits, claiming that he could “never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives."</span>	<button class="sent" id="p47">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p48">One of Ryan’s best one-liners came when he sought to explain these comments.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p48">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p49">Ryan first told a humanizing story about Romney caring for a family whose children were in a car crash, a story clearly prepared to push back against the portrait of Romney as out of touch and uncaring.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p49">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p50">And he then added: “With respect to that quote, I think the vice president very well knows that sometimes the words don't come out of your mouth the right way.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p50">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p51">Although there were extended portions of the debate that focused on Libya, Syria, and Afghanistan, Biden and Ryan did engage in a lengthy back-and-forth in the middle of the debate on Medicare and tax policy.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p51">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p52">Ryan was, as usual, knowledgeable and in command of the facts.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p52">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p53">But Biden, as expected, attempted to plow him over with broadsides.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p53">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p54">“Stop talking about how you care about people.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p54">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p55">Show me something. Show me a policy,” Biden said.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p55">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p56">Ryan smiled, and continued to work through a data-filled argument, mentioning the $831 billion stimulus, an 8 percent unemployment rate for 43 months, the 1.3 percent growth rate of the economy, the $90 billion for green energy programs in the stimulus, and the 12 million jobs he and Romney say their economic program would create.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p56">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p57">Biden didn’t worry so much about numbers.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p57">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p58">Biden’s argument on Medicare was aimed at voters’ guts, much more so than minds.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p58">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p59">He acknowledged that Romney’s Medicare plan would not cost seniors an extra $6,400 a year, despite the claim in a recently launched Obama campaign ad.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p59">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p60">The $6,400 figure is based on a study of one of Ryan’s earlier plans for Medicare, which he has since changed to make it more bipartisan.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p60">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p61">Biden, aware of this, told voters they should be suspicious somebody “who would actually put in motion a plan that … added $6,400 a year more to the cost of Medicare?”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p61">S</button><br><br>
