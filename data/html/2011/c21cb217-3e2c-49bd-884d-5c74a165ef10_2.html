        <i>Title: Rep. Weiner Denies Sending Lewd Photo, Can't Say Whether Image Is Him</i><br><br>
        <div id="article" onmouseup="annotate()"><span class="para" id="p0">Rep. Anthony Weiner, in an interview with Fox News, said Wednesday he's certain he did not send a lewd photo of somebody's bulging underwear to a college student via Twitter.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p0">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p1">But the congressman repeatedly declined to say whether the picture was an image of him.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p1">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p2">The congressman, who described the incident as "mischief," continued to allege that he was the victim of a computer hacker.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p2">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p3">He said he's asked an Internet security firm and a law firm to take a "hard look" at the incident and find out what happened, though he suggested he doesn't want to make a federal case out of it.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p3">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p4">He said somebody is just trying to distract him.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p4">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p5">"I know for a fact that my account was hacked," Weiner told Fox News.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p5">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p6">"I can definitively say that I did not send this."</span>	<button class="sent" id="p6">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p7">He also said he "certainly" does not know the college student the image was sent to -- though, when asked repeatedly, Weiner declined to say whether he was shown in the image.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p7">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p8">The New York Democrat, who is known for his combative style in interviews and on the House floor, granted a series of TV interviews after getting testy with reporters late Tuesday.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p8">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p9">At the time, he repeatedly said he would not allow the incident to distract him from his job, as he likened what he described as a "prank" to somebody shouting out an insult or throwing a pie during a speech.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p9">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p10">Asked point-blank, "Is that picture you?" Weiner replied, "You know I'm not going to talk about this anymore."</span>	<button class="sent" id="p10">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p11">"This is the tactic.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p11">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p12">The guy in the back of the room who's throwing the pie or yelling out the insult wants that to be the conversation," Weiner told reporters.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p12">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p13">"But I am not going to allow this thing to dominate what I talk about."</span>	<button class="sent" id="p13">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p14">As reporters continued to ask him for several minutes whether he sent the image, the exchange became heated.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p14">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p15">At one point, Weiner referred to a reporter in the scrum as a "jackass."</span>	<button class="sent" id="p15">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p16">Weiner referred to prior statements his office had put out, indicating he was through talking about the matter.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p16">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p17">Though Weiner's office had earlier responded to media inquiries, a few details appear to be keeping the story alive.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p17">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p18">Weiner's office initially said the congressman's account was "obviously hacked," but the representative has since taken to calling the incident a "prank" -- he used both terms Wednesday.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p18">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p19">The U.S. Capitol Police so far have not opened an investigation into the matter.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p19">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p20">A former Justice Department computer crimes prosecutor said it would not cost much to request an investigation from the FBI.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p20">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p21">The former official said if Weiner had called the FBI when the story broke, the public would already know where the Tweet originated.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p21">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p22">Though Weiner said the incident did not constitute a federal crime, the former official said multiple federal crimes would have been committed if somebody did hack into his account -- and it could lead to years behind bars.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p22">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p23">Amid the controversy, a Twitter official emailed security tips to members of Congress regarding their accounts.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p23">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p24">"While we won't comment on individual accounts, news reports of the past few days are a good reminder of the importance of actively protecting your account credentials," Twitter's Adam Sharp wrote.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p24">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p25">He urged offices to use a "strong password" of at least 10 characters including numbers and symbols, be on the lookout for "suspicious links," and refrain from giving out passwords to "untrusted third-parties."</span>	<button class="sent" id="p25">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p26">The photo in question showed a close-up shot of a man's bulging underwear.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p26">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p27">It was deleted within minutes of being sent.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p27">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p28">Breitbart's BigGovernment.com first reported that it was tweeted to a Seattle woman, later identified as Gennette Cordova.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p28">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p29">Cordova is just one of 198 people that Weiner follows on Twitter, though he has nearly 50,000 followers.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p29">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p30">Porn star Ginger Lee tweeted last month that she received a direct message from Weiner, and several other attractive women say they've been surprised to get a "follow" or a message from the prominent Democrat.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p30">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p31">Those claims are all circumstantial, but it doesn't help his case should there ever actually be one.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p31">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p32">Weiner, 46, is married to Huma Abedin, an aide to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p32">S</button><br><br>
