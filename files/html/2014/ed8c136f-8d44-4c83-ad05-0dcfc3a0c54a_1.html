        <i>Title: Eric Holder Hears From The People Of Ferguson Face To Face</i><br><br>
        <div id="article" onmouseup="annotate()"><span class="para" id="p0">FERGUSON, Mo. -- Attorney General Eric Holder said Wednesday that the “eyes of the nation and the world” are on this small suburb of St. Louis where an unarmed teenager was shot and killed by police earlier this month.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p0">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p1">The issues raised by Michael Brown's death, Holder said, have simmered “beneath the surface in more communities than just Ferguson.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p1">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p2">On Thursday, he told reporters in Washington that the Justice Department would thoroughly investigate the case, and would "continue to stand with Ferguson."</span>	<button class="sent" id="p2">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p3">He also said that "few things have affected me as greatly as my trip to Ferguson."</span>	<button class="sent" id="p3">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p4">Before a larger meeting at St. Louis Community College–Florissant Valley on Wednesday, the attorney general met with several students at the local school in what he described as an “opportunity to sit down with some wonderful young people and to hear them talk about the mistrust they have at a young age.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p4">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p5">Dominique McCoy, who attended the smaller meeting, told The Huffington Post that Holder said change wouldn't happen overnight.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p5">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p6">"He just let us speak, basically.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p6">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p7">He semi-voiced his opinion, but we all did the talking.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p7">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p8">He agreed somewhat to what everyone said,” McCoy added.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p8">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p9">A separate attendee, Molyrik Welch, noted to another reporter that her brother had died following an encounter with Ferguson police in 2011.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p9">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p10">Holder told the students he understands "the mistrust" between some residents and the police.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p10">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p11">“I am the attorney general of the United States, but I am also a black man," Holder said.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p11">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p12">Holder told others at the community college how he had been stopped on the New Jersey Turnpike and accused of speeding twice in the past, with police searching his car.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p12">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p13">"I remember how humiliating that was and how angry I was and the impact it had on me," Holder said.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p13">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p14">"The same kid who got stopped on the New Jersey freeway is now the attorney general of the United States," Holder added.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p14">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p15">"This country is capable of change. But change doesn't happen by itself."</span>	<button class="sent" id="p15">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p16">After the college events, Holder headed over to Drake's Place restaurant in Ferguson to talk with other community members.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p16">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p17">Some people were told that they would be meeting with an official from the Justice Department, but not that it was Holder.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p17">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p18">The owners of the restaurant said they were informed of the event only about an hour ahead of time.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p18">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p19">The Justice Department’s Community Relations Service had arranged for the gatherings.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p19">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p20">Holder was greeted as a star at Drake's Place, posing for selfies and group photos with residents and shaking hands.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p20">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p21">He settled into a corner booth as residents explained the problems that need to be rectified.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p21">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p22">Soon, Capt. Ron Johnson of the Missouri State Highway Patrol, who has earned some praise since he took over policing of Ferguson's nightly protests, stopped by to greet the attorney general.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p22">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p23">“My man! You are the man,” Holder said as Johnson walked in.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p23">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p24">After the meeting, attendees said they were thankful that Holder and the federal government were paying attention to Ferguson’s problems.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p24">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p25">“He told me that he was here because he was concerned about everything that was going on and he wanted us to voice our opinions and what did we want to change, and that he was going back to the White House to report so we can get some funding, so we can get a game plan on how to help our community,” Angela Whitman told HuffPost.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p25">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p26">Yvette Townsend-Saunders called the meeting “wonderful” and said she was thankful that Holder had come to the town.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p26">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p27">“He said that there needs to be some changes made, things need to be looked into and investigated,” Townsend-Saunders said.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p27">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p28">“When you were a little boy and you didn’t do something well at school, your mother had to jump in.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p28">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p29">When the teacher didn’t do something right, the principal had to jump in.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p29">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p30">I think if you do something right from the bottom, the top doesn’t have to jump in.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p30">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p31">If things were done right in the beginning, all this wouldn’t have to be.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p31">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p32">“We didn’t know it was Eric Holder [coming],” Rev. John Paul Hopping of Our Lady of Guadalupe, told HuffPost.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p32">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p33">“They were really nice and they were really listening.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p33">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p34">They’re looking for solutions and they want to help.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p34">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p35">At the community college, Holder said that they were starting “a good dialogue” but that it was “not enough.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p35">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p36">“We need concrete action to change things in this country,” he said, according to excerpts provided by the Justice Department.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p36">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p37">"This dialogue is important. But it can't simply be that we have a conversation that begins based on what happened on August 9 and ends sometime in December, and nothing happens.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p37">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p38">As I was just telling these young people, change is possible.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p38">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p39">The same kid who got stopped on the New Jersey freeway is now the attorney general of the United States.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p39">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p40">This country is capable of change. But change doesn't happen by itself.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p40">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p41">In addition to Ferguson community members, Holder spent Wednesday meeting with officials from the St. Louis-based U.S. attorney's office and the local FBI office investigating Brown's death.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p41">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p42">He is talking with Brown's parents and with members of the local congressional delegation.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p42">S</button><br><br>
