        <i>Title: Trump warns shutdown could last 'years,' says he may declare 'national emergency' to build border wall</i><br><br>
        <div id="article" onmouseup="annotate()"><span class="para" id="p0">President Trump stood firm Friday on his demands for a border wall after the second White House meeting with congressional leaders this week broke up with no apparent deal, warning Democrats the partial government shutdown could last "years" and saying he could even declare a "national emergency" to bypass Congress if necessary.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p0">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p1">“We can call a national emergency [to build a border wall] because of the security of our country,” Trump told reporters in the Rose Garden, during a lengthy and impromptu press conference.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p1">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p2">“I may do it,” he said, before adding, “If we can do it through a negotiated process, we’re giving it a shot.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p2">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p3">The press conference underscored how far apart both sides are, even as Trump called the meeting "productive" and suggested the standoff could end soon -- or not.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p3">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p4">He indicated he was not shifting on his demand for more than $5 billion for funding for a wall on the southern border, saying it was necessary as the border is a "dangerous, horrible disaster."</span>	<button class="sent" id="p4">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p5">"This is national security we’re talking about, we’re not talking about games," he told reporters.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p5">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p6">“We're not playing games, we have to do it."</span>	<button class="sent" id="p6">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p7">Despite Trump saying conversations had "come a long way," Democrats were more dour in their assessment.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p7">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p8">Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer exited saying Trump told them "he’d keep the government closed for a very long period of time, months or even years.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p8">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p9">Trump later confirmed in the Rose Garden, "Absolutely I said that," while clarifying he hopes the partial shutdown doesn't last more than a few more days.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p9">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p10">He said it could be opened "very quickly" if they come to an agreement on the wall.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p10">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p11">He offered some flexibility only on what the wall would be made of, saying it could be concrete or steel.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p11">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p12">"Steel is more expensive than the concrete, but I feel like we’re talking about steel because the other side feels better about it," he said.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p12">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p13">Yet House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the Democrats' view is that they cannot resolve the funding dispute until the government fully opens.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p13">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p14">She said there had been progress only in the sense of a "better understanding" of each other.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p14">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p15">Looking for an elusive resolution, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Trump agreed to designate staff to engage in negotiations with congressional leadership aides this weekend.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p15">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p16">Trump later said the group would "determine what we're going to do about the border."</span>	<button class="sent" id="p16">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p17">That group would include Vice President Pence and advisor Jared Kushner.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p17">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p18">The meeting came on the 14th day of the shutdown, which was triggered by disagreements over the funding of Trump’s promised wall, after Democrats formally took control of the House of Representatives.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p18">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p19">Trump has said that $5 billion in funding for the wall is non-negotiable, while Democrats have said they will fund more general border security -- but not the wall.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p19">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p20">Trump met with Democratic and Republican leaders of both chambers.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p20">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p21">Ahead of the meeting Trump sent a letter to members of Congress congratulating Pelosi on her election as speaker and calling on Congress to re-open the government.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p21">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p22">“As we begin this new Congress, our first task should be to reopen the Government and to deliver on our highest duty as elected officials: the security of the Nation and its borders," he said.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p22">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p23">“It is the sovereign right of every nation to establish an immigration program in its national interest—lawfully admitting those who have followed the rules, while denying entry to those who break the rules or fail to meet the requirements established in law."</span>	<button class="sent" id="p23">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p24">As part of his strategy, he made available to every member a presentation on border security that he said those present at a meeting Wednesday did not want to hear.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p24">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p25">“Americans have endured decades of broken promises on illegal immigration.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p25">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p26">Now, is the time for both parties to rise above the partisan discord, to set aside political convenience, and to put the national interest first,” he wrote.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p26">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p27">Democrats, meanwhile, passed legislation in the House that would fund the whole government, but not the wall.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p27">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p28">Pelosi accused Republicans of holding government workers hostage for the separate demand of a wall.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p28">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p29">"The wall and the government shutdown really have nothing to do with each other," Pelosi said at an MSNBC Town Hall.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p29">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p30">"There is no reason to have workers pay a price with their paycheck," she said</span>	<button class="sent" id="p30">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p31">The legislation was immediately dismissed by Republican leadership.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p31">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p32">McConnell, R-Ky., called the bills “a time-wasting act of political posturing” and said that “a resolution will have to be palatable to House Democrats and Senate Republicans alike.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p32">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p33">“We need to make policy rather than simply making political theatre,” he told reporters.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p33">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p34">White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said on "Fox & Friends" earlier Friday that it would be up to Pelosi to get her party behind her, including the left flank pushing for impeachment.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p34">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p35">“We think we're hopeful because the people that elected Nancy Pelosi didn't elect her to come up here and do nothing and didn't elect her to play political games,” she said.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p35">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p36">“They elected her to find real solutions and actually work with the president and work with all members of Congress to get things done.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p36">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p37">On Thursday night, Pence said on Fox News' “Tucker Carlson Tonight” that the terms of the negotiations were clear: "Bottom line, if there's no wall, there's no deal."</span>	<button class="sent" id="p37">S</button><br><br>
