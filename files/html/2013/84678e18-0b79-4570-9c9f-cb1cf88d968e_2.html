        <i>Title: I.R.S. Official Invokes 5th Amendment at Hearing</i><br><br>
        <div id="article" onmouseup="annotate()"><span class="para" id="p0">WASHINGTON — The Internal Revenue Service official who first disclosed that the agency had targeted conservative groups for special scrutiny, and in doing so ignited a controversy that has ensnared the White House, denied on Wednesday that she had ever provided false information to Congress.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p0">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p1">She then invoked her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and declined to testify at a House hearing on the agency’s actions.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p1">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p2">As the official, Lois Lerner, appeared under subpoena before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, she sternly told her questioners that accusations that she had misled Congress in previous testimony were false.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p2">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p3">“I have not done anything wrong.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p3">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p4">I have not broken any laws,” said Ms. Lerner, who leads the I.R.S.’s division on tax-exempt organizations.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p4">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p5">“I have not violated any I.R.S. rules and regulations, and I have not provided false information to this or any other Congressional committee.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p5">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p6">Ms. Lerner has become a person of intense interest to Congressional investigators, who insist that she made, at best, incomplete statements when she said she first learned that her subordinates had singled out Tea Party groups after reading news media reports last year.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p6">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p7">An inspector general’s report found, however, that she was briefed on their actions as early as June 2011.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p7">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p8">After she refused on Wednesday to say anything more to the committee, despite attempts by Representative Darrell Issa of California, the committee’s Republican chairman, to persuade her otherwise, Mr. Issa tried to dismiss her and her lawyer.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p8">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p9">But that upset other Republicans, who said that Ms. Lerner should not be let go so quickly.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p9">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p10">“You don’t get to tell your side of the story and then not be subjected to cross-examination,” said Representative Trey Gowdy of South Carolina.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p10">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p11">“She ought to stand here and answer our questions.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p11">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p12">Mr. Issa made a second attempt to persuade her to change her mind.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p12">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p13">But when she declined, he dismissed her again.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p13">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p14">Ms. Lerner then left the hearing room with her lawyer to a whir of camera shutters.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p14">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p15">That exchange set the tone for a contentious hearing that veered into veiled accusations that the White House had a larger role in the controversy than previously disclosed, as well as outright attacks on President Obama’s character.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p15">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p16">Mr. Issa said he reserved the right to recall Ms. Lerner later.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p16">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p17">And he may elect to do so, given the objections of some Republicans on Wednesday after he dismissed her.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p17">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p18">They argued that by making an opening statement, she had waived her Fifth Amendment right and could be compelled to testify, a contention Ms. Lerner’s lawyer disputed.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p18">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p19">The committee also heard testimony from Douglas H. Shulman, the former I.R.S. commissioner; Neal S. Wolin, the deputy secretary of the Treasury Department; and J. Russell George, the Treasury inspector general who looked into the accusations of targeting.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p19">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p20">And as the hearing continued, Republicans and Democrats pressed ahead with one point on which they agree these days: that an inept I.R.S. had committed serious misdeeds.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p20">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p21">“The power to tax is the power to destroy,” Mr. Issa said.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p21">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p22">Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, the senior Democrat on the committee, also scolded the agency.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p22">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p23">“I believe there was gross incompetence and mismanagement,” he said.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p23">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p24">“We are better than that. We are simply better than that.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p24">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p25">But Mr. Cummings also admonished his Republican colleagues.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p25">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p26">“I think we need to be very, very careful not to let partisanship undermine the integrity not only of the committee but our investigation and our work product,” he said.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p26">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p27">The hearing, the second this week on the I.R.S.’s efforts to target conservative groups, offered few new revelations.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p27">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p28">Mr. George did shed some light on the extent of the accusations against the I.R.S., saying that at this point in this investigation he had no reason to believe any illegal conduct occurred.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p28">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p29">“We do not deem it illegal. We do not believe that it was illegal, what they did,” he said.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p29">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p30">At times, committee members could hardly conceal their contempt for the I.R.S. and the Obama White House.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p30">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p31">Representative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio, tried to link the I.R.S. scandal with other controversies that are dogging the Obama administration.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p31">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p32">“This administration, which told us and told the American people that the attack that killed four Americans in Benghazi was the work, was caused by a video, is now the same administration who expects us to believe that this scandal was just the result of two rogue agents in Cincinnati,” he said.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p32">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p33">“The people don’t buy it.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p33">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p34">Representative James Lankford, Republican of Oklahoma, said the way that applicants for tax-exempt status were buried in I.R.S. paperwork reminded him of another sore point that Republicans have with the Obama administration.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p34">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p35">“Man, that sounds like the Keystone Pipeline to me,” he said, referring to the proposed cross-country oil pipeline that the president has so far declined to approve.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p35">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p36">One Democrat, Representative Stephen F. Lynch of Massachusetts, even raised the threat of appointing a special prosecutor if Congress continues to feel that the I.R.S. is not being straightforward.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p36">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p37">“We know where that will lead. It will lead to a special prosecutor,” he said.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p37">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p38">“There will be hell to pay if that’s the route we choose to go down.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p38">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p39">Later, Mr. Jordan pressed Mr. Shulman, the former I.R.S. commissioner, on whether he had visited the White House.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p39">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p40">When Mr. Shulman said he had, Mr. Jordan produced White House visitor records that he said indicated Mr. Shulman had been there at least 118 times.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p40">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p41">Was he sure, Mr. Jordan asked, that the I.R.S. targeting never came up?</span>	<button class="sent" id="p41">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p42">“One hundred-eighteen visits and it didn’t come up in casual conversation?” Mr. Jordan said.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p42">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p43">In follow-up questioning by Representative Gerald E. Connolly, a Virginia Democrat, Mr. Shulman offered what he said was one of the many plausible explanations why he would have visited the White House.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p43">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p44">“The Easter Egg Roll with my kids,” he said.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p44">S</button><br><br>
