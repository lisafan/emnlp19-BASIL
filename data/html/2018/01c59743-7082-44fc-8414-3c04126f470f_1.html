        <i>Title: Defense Secretary James Mattis to leave as of January 1; Trump taps Patrick Shanahan as acting secretary of defense</i><br><br>
        <div id="article" onmouseup="annotate()"><span class="para" id="p0">President Trump announced Sunday that Defense Secretary James Mattis will be leaving the administration on January 1, weeks earlier than planned and just days after Mattis' bombshell resignation letter made clear his policy disagreements with the White House.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p0">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p1">"I am pleased to announce that our very talented Deputy Secretary of Defense, Patrick Shanahan, will assume the title of Acting Secretary of Defense starting January 1, 2019," Trump wrote on Twitter Sunday morning.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p1">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p2">"Patrick has a long list of accomplishments while serving as Deputy, & previously Boeing.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p2">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p3">He will be great!"</span>	<button class="sent" id="p3">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p4">Shanahan is a former Boeing executive who joined the Pentagon in July 2017.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p4">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p5">In his resignation letter Thursday, Mattis, 68, had said he would remain in his role for more than three months.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p5">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p6">Also on Thursday, Trump had said Mattis -- the first Cabinet official in 40 years to resign over a stated policy difference with the president -- was leaving in February.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p6">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p7">"The end date for my tenure is February 28, 2019, a date that should allow sufficient time for a successor to be nominated and confirmed as well as to make sure the Department's interests are properly articulated and protected at upcoming events to include Congressional posture hearings and the NATO Defense Ministerial meeting in February," Mattis wrote Thursday.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p7">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p8">It was not immediately clear why Mattis' departure date was apparently moved up, but tension in the Defense Department and Washington generally has skyrocketed in the days since he suddenly announced his resignation.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p8">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p9">Sources told Fox News this week that Mattis had quit "in protest" over the president's national security policies and that more resignations could be coming.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p9">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p10">(In 2013, then-President Obama removed Mattis from his post running U.S. military's Central Command, reportedly without calling to notify him of the decision.)</span>	<button class="sent" id="p10">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p11">U.S. officials said this week that the Trump administration is making plans to pull all 2,000 troops out of Syria, and Trump later tweeted that “we have defeated ISIS in Syria, my only reason for being there during the Trump Presidency.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p11">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p12">Trump has stood by his Syria decision despite fierce blowback, telling detractors that the pullout should come as “no surprise” given his 2016 campaign promises and arguing that America’s role as “Policeman of the Middle East” is not worth the sacrifice.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p12">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p13">Ground troops moved into Syria in 2015 to combat ISIS in the region, amid an escalating Syrian civil war.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p13">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p14">Trump had talked about pulling out of Syria before, but military leaders had warned about ISIS re-emerging should the U.S. do so.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p14">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p15">There is also concern about abandoning the U.S.' Kurdish allies.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p15">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p16">The news that Mattis will be leaving sooner than expected comes just days after Brett McGurk, the U.S. envoy for the global coalition to defeat Islamic State (ISIS), on Saturday accelerated his planned departure and announced his resignation.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p16">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p17">The Associated Press reported that McGurk said in a resignation letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that ISIS was on the run, but wasn’t yet defeated and that U.S. work in Syria wasn’t yet done.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p17">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p18">Fox News has confirmed that McGurk submitted his resignation letter on Friday, a day after Mattis resigned.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p18">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p19">His resignation is effective December 31.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p19">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p20">The president downplayed the news via Twitter Saturday evening, saying he had neither met McGurk nor appointed him.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p20">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p21">"Brett McGurk, who I do not know, was appointed by President Obama in 2015.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p21">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p22">Was supposed to leave in February but he just resigned prior to leaving," Trump tweeted.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p22">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p23">"Grandstander? The Fake News is making such a big deal about this nothing event!"</span>	<button class="sent" id="p23">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p24">"If anybody but your favorite President, Donald J. Trump, announced that, after decimating ISIS in Syria, we were going to bring our troops back home (happy & healthy), that person would be the most popular hero in America," he continued in a follow-up tweet.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p24">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p25">"With me, hit hard instead by the Fake News Media. Crazy!"</span>	<button class="sent" id="p25">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p26">Meanwhile, the White House's plan to withdraw half its troops in Afghanistan by the summer -- some 7,000 soldiers -- has drawn similar criticism.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p26">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p27">While President Obama repeatedly promised to pull all troops out of Afghanistan by 2014, U.S. and NATO forces remain there in a predominately training and advising role.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p27">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p28">Afghanistan's security forces rely heavily on U.S. airpower against both Taliban and an upstart Islamic State affiliate.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p28">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p29">More than 2,400 American soldiers have died in Afghanistan since the 2001 U.S.-led invasion, and Trump announced in a video last week that troop deaths were on his mind in announcing the pullouts.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p29">S</button><br><br>
