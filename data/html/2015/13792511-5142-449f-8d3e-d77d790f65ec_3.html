<span class="para" id="p1">New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) announced he's running for president in 2016.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p1">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p2">Christie told supporters of his plans in a phone call Tuesday morning, according to NBC and the AP.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p2">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p3">Christie made a public announcement Tuesday afternoon at Livingston High School, his alma mater, in Livingston, New Jersey.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p3">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p4">"I am now ready to fight for the people of the United States of America," Christie said at the public announcement.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p4">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p5">He praised his home state during his speech, sharing how working as governor inspired him to run for president.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p5">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p6">Christie also took hits at lawmakers in Washington, including President Barack Obama, claiming a lack of productivity from Congress is giving Americans anxiety.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p6">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p7">"Both parties have failed our country... both parties have led us to believe that America, a country that was built on compromise -- that compromise is somehow a dirty word," Christie said.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p7">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p8">"We need to have the courage to choose, we need to have the courage to stand up and say 'enough,'" Christie added.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p8">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p9">Christie, a tough-talking former federal prosecutor whose reputation for political bullying was reinforced by a George Washington Bridge lane-closing scandal last year, has served as New Jersey governor since January 2010, winning election twice in a state where Democrats greatly outnumber Republicans.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p9">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p10">He notably led the state during catastrophic damage from Hurricane Sandy in 2012.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p10">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p11">Christie's favorability rating among voters skyrocketed after he made himself visible through interviews, press conferences and tours of storm damage during the disaster.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p11">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p12">Christie focused on his state rather than the presidential election that took place days after New Jersey's shore was ravaged by the storm.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p12">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p13">HuffPost reported in November 2012 Christie turned down an invitation to appear at an event with Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney days ahead of the election.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p13">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p14">Instead, Christie was seen that October praising President Barack Obama for responsiveness and "leadership" in the storm's aftermath.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p14">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p15">In an October 2012 interview with Fox News, Christie said he didn't "give a damn about presidential politics" in the wake of the storm.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p15">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p16">"I have got a job to do here in New Jersey that is much bigger than presidential politics.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p16">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p17">And I could care less about any of that stuff," Christie said.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p17">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p18">Christie was elected chairman of the Republican Governors Association in November 2013.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p18">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p19">He worked within that role to raise money and contribute to the campaigns of Republican governors across the U.S., many of whom won in the 2014 midterm elections.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p19">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p20">While serving as chair of the governors association, Christie held prep sessions on foreign policy with officials, business leaders and academics in an attempt to ready himself for a White House run, according The Associated Press.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p20">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p21">Known for his blunt speaking style, Christie has acknowledged that he can come off brash and confrontational.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p21">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p22">"I'm not everybody's cup of tea, but I'm not in this business to get elected to prom king.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p22">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p23">My job is to lead, and that's what I try to do," Christie said in 2014, according to the AP.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p23">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p24">His image suffered a major blow in 2014, when it was revealed members of his administration, including his deputy chief of staff, were involved in a plot to cause traffic jams near the George Washington Bridge to retaliate against a mayor who hadn't supported Christie's 2013 re-election.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p24">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p25">Dubbed "Bridgegate," the controversy caused Christie, who had enjoyed high favorability ratings, to see his negatives rise sharply.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p25">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p26">Christie has also faced criticism for reversinghis position recently on Common Core education standards.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p26">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p27">Christie initially supported the standards but said recently that he no longer supports them because of how they've played out in his state.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p27">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p28">According to HuffPost Pollster, Christie is in the middle of the pack of GOP presidential candidates.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p28">S</button><br><br>
