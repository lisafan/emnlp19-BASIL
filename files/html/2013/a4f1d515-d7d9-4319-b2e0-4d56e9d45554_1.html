        <i>Title: White House Plays Down Data Program</i><br><br>
        <div id="article" onmouseup="annotate()"><span class="para" id="p0">WASHINGTON — The Obama administration tried Saturday to marshal new evidence in defense of its collection of private Internet and telephone data, arguing that a secret program called Prism is simply an “internal government computer system” designed to sort through court-supervised collection of data, and that Congress has been briefed 13 times on the programs since 2009.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p0">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p1">After rushing to declassify some carefully selected descriptions of the programs, James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence, conceded for the first time that the Prism program existed.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p1">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p2">But in a statement, after denouncing the leak of the data to The Guardian and The Washington Post, Mr. Clapper insisted it was “not an undisclosed collection or data mining program.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p2">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p3">Instead, he said it was a computer system to “facilitate” the collection of foreign intelligence that had been authorized by Congress.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p3">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p4">Mr. Clapper also insisted that the government “does not unilaterally obtain information from the servers” of telephone and Internet providers, saying that information is turned over only under court order, when there is a “documented, foreign intelligence purpose for acquisition” of the data.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p4">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p5">He appeared to be attempting to push back against early reports that the government had direct access to the huge computer servers at Google, Microsoft, Facebook and similar companies.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p5">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p6">Those firms have denied they give the government a “back door” to their systems.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p6">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p7">But they acknowledge handing over material when ordered to do so by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, though they have not described the mechanism for complying with those orders.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p7">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p8">It appears the companies use some kind of electronic drop box, in which they place the material, so that the government can then harvest the information.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p8">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p9">The national intelligence director’s rare Saturday statement was notable for what it omitted: any description of other means the government may use to intercept Internet information directly from fiber optic cables or satellite systems even before or after it reaches those Internet companies.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p9">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p10">A new report in The Guardian, published online on Saturday, cited another document that showed that in March 2013 there were 97 billion pieces of data collected from networks worldwide; about 14 percent of it was from Iran, much was from Pakistan and about 3 percent came from inside the United States, though some of that may have been foreign data traffic routed through American-based servers.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p10">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p11">Meanwhile, senior Obama administration officials, including the directors of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and of national intelligence, have held 13 classified hearings and briefings for members of Congress since 2009 to explain the broad authority they say they have to sweep up electronic records for national security purposes, a senior administration official said Saturday.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p11">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p12">The administration, by disclosing the briefings, sought to push back on claims by Democrats and Republicans in Congress that they were either not aware of programs to mine vast amounts of Internet data and business telephone records or were insufficiently briefed on the details.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p12">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p13">Lawmakers said that what they knew was vague and broad — and that strict rules of classification prevented them from truly debating the programs or conducting proper oversight.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p13">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p14">In separate but identical letters sent on Oct. 19, 2011, Assistant Attorney General Ronald Weich told two of Congress’s most outspoken critics of the efforts, Senators Ron Wyden of Oregon and Mark Udall of Colorado, both Democrats, that in December 2009 and February 2011 the Justice Department and intelligence agencies provided a classified document to Congress describing the surveillance efforts in detail.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p14">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p15">The letter said the House and Senate Intelligence Committees had been briefed “on these operations multiple times and have had access to copies of the classified” orders and opinions of the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p15">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p16">Members of the committee were invited to share the information with other lawmakers.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p16">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p17">Broader briefings were held in 2011 before the reauthorization of the Patriot Act, the post-Sept. 11 law that authorized much of the surveillance.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p17">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p18">“Against this backdrop, we do not believe the executive branch is operating pursuant to ‘secret law’ or ‘secret opinions of the Department of Justice,’ ” Mr. Weich wrote.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p18">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p19">“Rather, the intelligence community is conducting court-authorized intelligence activities pursuant to a public statute, with the knowledge and oversight of Congress and the Intelligence Committees of both houses.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p19">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p20">On Friday, Mr. Udall and Mr. Wyden released a joint statement repeating that they had “long been concerned about the degree to which this collection has relied on ‘secret law.’ ”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p20">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p21">“Senior administration officials have stated on multiple occasions that the Patriot Act’s ‘business records’ authority is ‘analogous to a grand jury subpoena,’ ” they said.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p21">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p22">They added that “multiple senior officials have stated that U.S. intelligence agencies do not collect information or dossiers on ‘millions of Americans,’ ” assertions that they believe have been contradicted by revelations of Internet data mining and a court order asking a Verizon subsidiary to turn over logs of telephone calls.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p22">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p23">“Now that the fact of bulk collection has been declassified, we believe that more information about the scale of the collection, and specifically whether it involves the records of ‘millions of Americans,’ should be declassified as well,” they said.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p23">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p24">The list of briefings begins on May 12, 2009, with a classified hearing of the Senate Intelligence Committee involving Gen. Keith B. Alexander, the head of the United States Cyber Command, and David S. Kris, assistant attorney general for national security.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p24">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p25">On Feb. 14, 2011, all senators were offered the opportunity to discuss the broad authority under the Patriot Act with the director of national intelligence, Mr. Clapper; the F.B.I. director, Robert S. Mueller III; and General Alexander.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p25">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p26">Mr. Mueller spoke to the House Republican Conference on May 13, 2011, and to the House Democratic Caucus on May 24, 2011.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p26">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p27">On Feb. 8, 2011, Senators Dianne Feinstein of California, the chairwoman of the Intelligence Committee, and Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, the ranking Republican on the panel, invited every senator to a briefing with Mr. Clapper and Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. to discuss expiring provisions of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p27">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p28">The provisions — “one on roving authority for electronic surveillance and the other on the acquisition of business records that are relevant to investigations to protect against international terrorism or espionage” — were added to the 1978 law by the Patriot Act.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p28">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p29">But Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the Senate’s No. 2 Democrat, draws a distinction between the holding of such briefings and the informed consent of Congress.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p29">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p30">Very few lawmakers avail themselves of such briefings, he suggested, and only the most senior leaders are kept fully abreast of intelligence activities.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p30">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p31">“You can count on two hands the number of people in Congress who really know,” he said in an interview on Friday.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p31">S</button><br><br>
