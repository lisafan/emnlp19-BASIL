        <div id="article" onmouseup="annotate()"><span class="para" id="p0">WASHINGTON — Representative Raúl R. Labrador, a Republican of Idaho who has barely served two terms in Congress, jumped into the race for House majority leader on Friday, offering himself as the more conservative alternative who could pull the House rightward in the wake of Representative Eric Cantor’s loss in a primary.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p0">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p1">“The message from Tuesday is clear — Americans are looking for a change in the status quo,” Mr. Labrador, a former immigration lawyer elected in the Tea Party wave of 2010, said in a statement.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p1">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p2">“President Obama and the Democrats have had their chance and they have failed.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p2">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p3">Republicans must be willing to take these challenges head on with new leadership, fresh ideas and a different approach.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p3">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p4">While some of those conservative lawmakers elected in 2010 were hoping that the House leadership elections on Thursday would offer them the chance to reclaim their influence on Capitol Hill, few of them give Mr. Labrador much of a chance against the current House majority whip, Representative Kevin McCarthy of California.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p4">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p5">Though Tea Party activists provided the energy and votes for Mr. Cantor’s ouster, the elections might be more of a plea for a place at the leadership table.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p5">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p6">Supporters of Mr. McCarthy, who confidently traveled home to his district in Bakersfield for the weekend, said Friday that the Californian had all but sewed up the votes he needs.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p6">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p7">“We have got to have an alternative,” Representative Louie Gohmert, Republican of Texas, said on Glenn Beck’s conservative radio show.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p7">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p8">“I mean, for us as a party in Congress to send the message that we didn’t learn a blessed thing from this amazing election result, we aren’t paying attention.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p8">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p9">House conservatives — lacking a rationale to fight Mr. McCarthy, a well-liked member of leadership who has raised millions of dollars for Republican incumbents — have begun protesting that his voting record is actually to the left of Mr. Cantor’s.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p9">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p10">FreedomWorks, which has provided financial support for Tea Party candidates, immediately began trying to generate support for Mr. Labrador through its websites and email lists.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p10">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p11">“Now that grass-roots conservatives FIRED Eric Cantor, we need a new majority leader in the House of Representatives,” FreedomWorks’ website said Friday.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p11">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p12">Matt Kibbe, the group’s president and chief executive, said that he did not have great qualms with Mr. McCarthy’s ideology, but that he was more about politics than ideas.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p12">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p13">“The Republican penchant for just choosing the next guy in line hasn’t proven to be a great strategy, and it hasn’t picked good leadership,” Mr. Kibbe said.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p13">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p14">But Mr. Labrador’s path to victory is steep, especially in the few days before House Republicans gather to elect Mr. Cantor’s replacement.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p14">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p15">Mr. McCarthy has been preparing for months to move up from No. 3 in the Republican leadership to No. 2 in the event that Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio would retire after the November elections.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p15">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p16">Conservative Republicans in the House pleaded Friday for a delay in the voting.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p16">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p17">Some grumbled that the campaign by the college professor David Brat to unseat Mr. Cantor had ousted the one member of House Republican leadership willing to listen to the House’s most conservative members.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p17">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p18">Instead, the House will end up elevating a leader with a less conservative record and less patience for the far-right flank.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p18">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p19">For his part, Mr. Boehner has remained firm that he wanted to get it done quickly and minimize disruption.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p19">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p20">Mr. McCarthy spent much of the day calling members and shoring up support, said a Republican aide close to the majority whip.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p20">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p21">McCarthy supporters predicted that Mr. Labrador would muster no more than a few dozen votes.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p21">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p22">Some lawmakers questioned whether his run was really a quest to win the majority leader’s post or merely to raise his own profile.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p22">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p23">His decision to jump in was widely seen as proof that more experienced conservative members, like Representatives Jim Jordan of Ohio or Tom Price of Georgia, had rebuffed overtures to run from other conservatives.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p23">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p24">Tea Party groups off Capitol Hill may believe Mr. Labrador can win, and they will pressure House conservatives to join the campaign.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p24">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p25">But ultimately, supporting him could hurt more conservative members with the House leadership.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p25">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p26">Mr. Labrador tried on Friday to at least engage the Republican conference in a debate over ideas.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p26">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p27">He said the party needed to address issues like upward income mobility among the poor and middle-class economic insecurity.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p27">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p28">Born the son of a single mother in Puerto Rico, he has seen himself as an ambassador to young and minority voters out of reach to traditional Republicans.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p28">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p29">“I am running for majority leader because I want to help create a vision of growth and opportunity for everyone and start getting to work for the American people,” he said.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p29">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p30">Representative Justin Amash, Republican of Michigan, rushed to champion Mr. Labrador’s candidacy.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p30">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p31">Mr. Amash, after all, voted last year to make him speaker of the House.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p31">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p32">“We can’t respond to a stunning loss by giving a pat on the back and promotion to the same team,” Mr. Amash said of Mr. Cantor’s defeat.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p32">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p33">“It’s time for someone new, someone conservative, someone who will put forward a fresh agenda, and someone we know is a proven and talented spokesman. That man is Raúl Labrador.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p33">S</button><br><br>
