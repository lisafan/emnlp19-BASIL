        <i>Title: Trump Says Defense Secretary Jim Mattis Will Retire In February</i><br><br>
        <div id="article" onmouseup="annotate()"><span class="para" id="p0">President Donald Trump tweeted on Thursday that Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, a retired Marine general who was one of Trump’s first Cabinet picks, would be retiring at the end of February.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p0">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p1">Mattis, who served more than four decades in the military and headed the U.S. Central Command from 2010 to 2013, won Senate confirmation as defense secretary on Jan. 20, 2017, shortly after Trump’s inauguration.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p1">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p2">The Pentagon chief, nicknamed “Mad Dog Mattis” during his time as a Marine, echoed Trump’s call for strengthening the military and beefing up its combat readiness.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p2">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p3">The budget bill the president signed into law in February earmarked $700 billion for the Defense Department this fiscal year ― a more than 15 percent increase over the previous year and the biggest hike in military spending since 2002.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p3">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p4">Mattis’ resignation letter addressed to Trump indicates his final day in office will be Feb. 28.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p4">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p5">“I am proud of the progress that has been made over the past two years on some of the key goals articulated in our National Defense Strategy: putting the Department on a more sound budgetary footing, improving readiness and lethality in our forces, and reforming the Department’s business practices for greater performance, he wrote.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p5">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p6">“Our troops continue to provide the capabilities needed to prevail in conflict and sustain strong U.S. global influence.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p6">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p7">In the unusual letter, Mattis also wrote that he and Trump had differing views on Russian and Chinese authoritarianism: “Because you have the right to have a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours on these and other subjects, I believe it is right for me to step down from my position.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p7">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p8">Earlier this week, Trump went against Mattis by abruptly withdrawing U.S. troops from Syria.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p8">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p9">Mattis had previously argued that a small U.S. presence should remain because the counterterrorism mission there is ongoing and removing troops now would cause more problems for the region.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p9">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p10">Additionally, forces were withdrawn despite the concern by many Republicans that “leaving would strengthen the hand of Russia and Iran, which both support Syrian President Bashar al Assad.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p10">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p11">News of Mattis’ departure comes in the wake of reports that the White House had been discussing who might replace him, a topic that was first reported by The Washington Post in early September.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p11">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p12">Some of the top names that were reportedly under consideration included four-star Army Gen. Jack Keane, Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), former Treasury Department official David McCormick and former Republican Sen. Jim Talent of Missouri.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p12">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p13">Trump denied that he had been looking to replace Mattis, telling reporters that he was “very happy” with him.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p13">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p14">That assurance came ahead of the release of a book by acclaimed Watergate journalist Bob Woodward, which reported that Mattis once told staffers that Trump has the understanding of a “fifth- or sixth-grader.” Mattis has denied having said that.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p14">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p15">A major split between Trump and Mattis concerned Russian President Vladimir Putin.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p15">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p16">The defense secretary has characterized Putin as trying to undermine NATO and assaulting Western democracies while violating international norms.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p16">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p17">“[Putin’s] actions are designed not to challenge our arms at this point, but to undercut and compromise our belief in our ideals,” Mattis told U.S. Naval War College graduates at a commencement ceremony in June.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p17">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p18">Trump, in contrast, has praised Putin’s leadership skills and recently roiled U.S. allies by calling for Russia’s reinstatement to the Group of Seven major industrial nations.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p18">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p19">Russia was expelled from what was then the Group of Eight after its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p19">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p20">Mattis had also argued that the U.S. should consider staying in the Iran nuclear deal unless Tehran was found not to be abiding by the multi-nation agreement.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p20">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p21">Iran was following the pact’s rules, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency, which monitors the use of nuclear energy and has verified Iranian compliance with the accord multiple times since 2015.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p21">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p22">Trump went on to pull out of the deal in May, claiming that it had been poorly negotiated during the Obama administration.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p22">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p23">Mattis opposed Trump’s proposed ban on transgender service members, as well as the use of torture in the interrogation of terrorist suspects.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p23">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p24">His most prominent moment in the public spotlight occurred in April when he handled briefings on Trump’s decision to conduct targeted airstrikes against Syria in response to the alleged use of chemical weapons by Assad’s regime in that nation’s civil war.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p24">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p25">Even then, Mattis’ recommendation that congressional approval be sought for the strikes put him at odds with the president.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p25">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p26">Trump overruled the defense secretary and unilaterally ordered the military assault.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p26">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p27">Mattis joins a growing list of high-profile departures from the administration.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p27">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p28">Trump fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson earlier this year, and Tom Price stepped aside as secretary of health and human services last fall amid ethical questions about his travel practices.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p28">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p29">Reince Priebus lasted barely six months as White House chief of staff, and Sean Spicer had a similarly short tenure as press secretary.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p29">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p30">White House Communications Director Hope Hicks, a Trump aide before he won the presidency, announced her resignation in February.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p30">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p31">White House deputy chief of staff Joe Hagin, who also served in the Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush administrations, is expected to leave his post in July, Politico reported.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p31">S</button><br><br>
