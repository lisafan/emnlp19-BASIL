        <i>Title: Trump’s Border Wall Shutdown Continues Into A New Congress With A Democratic House</i><br><br>
        <div id="article" onmouseup="annotate()"><span class="para" id="p0">WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump’s partial government shutdown over his border wall closed in on the two-week mark and a brand-new Congress on Wednesday with no end in sight.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p0">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p1">Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker-to-be Nancy Pelosi made their first visit to the White House since their Dec. 11 meeting with Trump, when he said he would be “proud” to take responsibility for a government shutdown in his effort to force Congress to spend billions of dollars on a wall along the southern border.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p1">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p2">On Wednesday, the Democratic leaders emerged from the White House after 90 minutes, unified on not giving in to Trump.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p2">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p3">“They are now feeling the heat,” Schumer said.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p3">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p4">Pelosi, who is expected to return to the House speakership Thursday afternoon after eight years as minority leader, intends as her first action to pass spending bills that won Republican support last year to reopen the closed agencies.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p4">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p5">“We’re asking the president to open the government,” she told reporters on the White House driveway.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p5">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p6">“We are giving him a Republican path to do that.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p6">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p7">Why would he not do that?”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p7">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p8">Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, though, said he will not take up legislation that Trump has not endorsed, which means the shutdown will continue.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p8">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p9">About a quarter of the federal government ran out of operating money at midnight Dec. 21 after Trump reneged on his commitment to a sign a short-term spending bill that had already passed the Senate on a unanimous vote.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p9">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p10">Trump changed his mind after Fox News and talk radio hosts ridiculed him for again backing down on his demand for wall money.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p10">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p11">Trump is now insisting that Congress appropriate $5.7 billion for that project, while Democrats want a short-term spending bill for the Department of Homeland Security and full-year funding for the other affected agencies while funding for the wall is negotiated separately.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p11">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p12">In the meantime, about 800,000 federal employees ― about half furloughed, half deemed “essential” and required to work anyway ― face real problems with their household finances.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p12">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p13">Many will miss their first paycheck on Jan. 11 unless Trump signs a spending bill before then.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p13">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p14">Employees would have to dip into their savings or borrow money to pay their bills, as there is no government program to help them.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p14">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p15">Trump, however, did not mention them during extended remarks he offered shortly before his meeting with the eight top Democratic and Republican congressional leaders.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p15">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p16">When asked how long the shutdown would last, the president replied, “As long as it takes,” calling his wall, a signature campaign promise, a matter of “national security.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p16">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p17">Trump’s comments came at what was billed as the first Cabinet meeting of 2019.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p17">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p18">Instead, Trump spent the first hour and a half of it complaining about a variety of issues, such as former Defense Secretary James Mattis’ performance and the late Sen. John McCain’s vote against Trump’s repeal of Obamacare, as well as offering his musings on such things as the utility of wheels and his desire for Russia to invade Afghanistan again.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p18">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p19">Trump’s remarks were riddled with falsehoods on everything from trade to the number of illegal immigrants in the country to the way NATO works.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p19">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p20">The White House did not respond to HuffPost queries about whether Trump understood that what he was saying was false and, if he did, why he was doing so anyway.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p20">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p21">Trump promised hundreds of times during his campaign that the wall would cost taxpayers nothing because he would get Mexico to pay for it.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p21">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p22">But since taking office, Trump has never asked Mexico for payment.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p22">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p23">Instead, he began threatening to shut down the government early last year unless Congress gave him billions of dollars to build it ― even though the type of structure he wants remains unclear.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p23">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p24">During the campaign, he promised a “great, great” wall made of reinforced concrete that would rise 30 feet or more and extend so far underground that it would be impossible to tunnel underneath.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p24">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p25">In recent months, he has at times said the wall could just be steel slats, which would be like the “bollard fencing” developed during President Barack Obama’s administration.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p25">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p26">In a tweet Wednesday morning, Trump claimed, falsely, that Mexico was already paying for a border wall, thanks to a newly renegotiated trade deal, and that the wall was already largely done but he needed billions of dollars anyway.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p26">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p27">Despite numerous requests over several weeks, the White House has not provided any economic analysis to back up Trump’s claims.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p27">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p28">Outside economists and trade experts, however, said the revisions in the North American Free Trade Agreement, which Trump has rebranded the United States Mexico Canada Agreement, will not bring in to the U.S. Treasury anywhere near what is necessary to pay for a wall.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p28">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p29">More important, what extra money does come in will be from tariffs, which are paid by people in the U.S., not Mexico.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p29">S</button><br><br>
