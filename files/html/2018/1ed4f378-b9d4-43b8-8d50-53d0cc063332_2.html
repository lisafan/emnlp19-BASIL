        <div id="article" onmouseup="annotate()"><span class="para" id="p0">Senate Democrats’ Vote to End Shutdown Infuriates Some on the Left</span>	<button class="sent" id="p0">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p1">WASHINGTON — The decision by Senate Democrats to end the government shutdown on Monday in exchange for a promised immigration vote enraged liberals, who accused the lawmakers of betrayal and threatened to mount primaries against some of the Democrats who voted yes.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p1">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p2">Regardless of what happens in the Senate, progressive and immigrant advocacy groups said House Republican leaders will never take up a bill that would offer legal status to young undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children without excruciating concessions on other immigration issues.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p2">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p3">They accused Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, and moderate Democratic senators of capitulating to protect senators up for re-election in November in Republican-leaning states.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p3">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p4">“They blinked because they’ll always put the party and the success of the party first,” said Representative Luis V. Gutiérrez of Illinois, one of the leading Democratic advocates for immigrants, complaining that Hispanics got short shrift.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p4">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p5">“It’s the one word they know in Spanish: mañana.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p5">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p6">The hasty retreat by 33 Senate Democrats was particularly humiliating in the immediate aftermath of the anniversary of the Women’s March, which saw thousands of activists reconvene in cities across the country to protest against President Trump and congressional Republicans.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p6">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p7">Liberal groups such as MoveOn.org began urging members to sign up on Monday for rallies aimed at pressuring Republicans to protect the young undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p7">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p8">By noon, their own ostensible allies in Congress had buckled.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p8">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p9">“The grass-roots are rightly furious with a slew of elected Democrats,” said Ben Wikler, the Washington director of MoveOn.org.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p9">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p10">“In the Obama years, Republicans learned to be more afraid of primary challenges than general elections.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p10">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p11">But Democrats are still operating as though the Tea Party is more powerful than The Resistance.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p11">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p12">The anger on the left was reminiscent of conservative unrest that fueled primary race challenges against sitting Republican senators accused of appeasing an opposition president, Barack Obama, and his congressional allies.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p12">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p13">Mr. Schumer, determined to keep the fissures in his party coalition muted, used a meeting of Senate Democrats before the vote to urge the liberals in his caucus not to criticize those voting to reopen the government, according to one senator who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a private meeting.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p13">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p14">And for the most part, the liberal senators who opposed the agreement held their fire.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p14">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p15">Democrats have largely avoided the internal insurrections that upended Republicans over the past decade.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p15">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p16">Mr. Schumer is not a figure of derision on the left as Mr. McConnell is on the right.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p16">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p17">And Senate Democrats have crushed most primary election challenges easily.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p17">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p18">Senate leaders have intervened freely in a number of 2018 races — in states like Arizona and Tennessee — to anoint more moderate standard-bearers.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p18">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p19">Former Senator Byron L. Dorgan, Democrat of North Dakota, said Democrats from the more rural states that make up much of the 2018 map would prefer to battle over issues other than immigration.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p19">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p20">The Obama-era program that protected young undocumented immigrants — Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA — is an important issue, he said, but “it isn’t the bread and butter of successful Democrat politics.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p20">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p21">“Our major issues are jobs, Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, Social Security, infrastructure, supporting domestic programs, clean air, safe drinking water,” Mr. Dorgan said, adding of his conservative-state brethren, “While those Democrats do strongly support DACA, I’m sure they would prefer to be discussing different issues.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p21">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p22">But the patience of the left may be running thin.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p22">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p23">By appearing to retreat on Monday, Democrats have stirred new talk on the left about challenging incumbents who had previously given little thought to their own nominations.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p23">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p24">Faiz Shakir, the political director of the American Civil Liberties Union and an adviser to former Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, said the group and its allies were actively exploring places to intervene in primary elections.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p24">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p25">Mr. Shakir said of some Democrats that it is an “open question, still, whether they’re going to fight for Dreamers.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p25">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p26">Right now, only one Democratic senator faces a serious primary challenge: Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, who voted against the government-funding deal and complained privately that she and most of her colleagues had been asked to vote on Friday against a nearly identical measure to keep the government open.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p26">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p27">Ms. Feinstein has tacked to the left since Kevin de Léon, the president of the California State Senate, announced his challenge to her in October.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p27">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p28">Mr. de Léon said Monday that Democrats had made a grave mistake striking “another fingers-crossed bargain with Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p28">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p29">Mr. de Léon said he had called and left a voice mail message with Thomas E. Perez, the Democratic National Committee chairman, and planned to convey that Democrats had sent a terrible message to “voters of color and millennial voters who feel like they’ve been abandoned.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p29">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p30">“Once again, the party’s leaders in Washington have capitulated, compromised and redrawn a line in the sand even further away from justice,” he said.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p30">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p31">One House Democrat is already under fire for not taking a stronger stance on behalf of immigrants: Representative Daniel Lipinski of Illinois, a moderate Democrat from Chicago who is facing a primary race challenger, Marie Newman, in March.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p31">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p32">“I asked him to sign on to Dream bill.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p32">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p33">He said, ‘I don’t think I can do that,’” said Mr. Gutiérrez, whoendorsed Ms. Newman last week.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p33">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p34">(Mr. Lipinski opposed the measure in 2010 but has said in recent months that he would support it if it comes to the House floor.)</span>	<button class="sent" id="p34">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p35">The chances of a successful primary election challenge in the Senate are far more remote.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p35">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p36">Many of the Democrats facing re-election in November hail from states that Mr. Trump carried and are more concerned about well-funded Republican opponents than liberal challengers.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p36">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p37">Of the 10 Democrats who gathered outside the Senate chamber after the vote to crow about their bipartisan agreement, six are on the ballot this year.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p37">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p38">“If you want results, you have to compromise, and if you’re unwilling to compromise, you won’t get results,” said Senator Heidi Heitkamp, Democrat of North Dakota.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p38">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p39">“You maybe get a political issue, but you won’t get results.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p39">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p40">And I didn’t come here to do politics.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p40">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p41">Progressives, however, are already eyeing one of the Democrats who pushed for a compromise: Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p41">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p42">On a conference call convened Sunday night by liberal groups, there was notable anger toward Ms. Klobuchar, according to two participants.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p42">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p43">Ms. Klobuchar, however, illustrates why the Democratic base may find it difficult to inflict payback: She is broadly popular with liberals in Minnesota, and the shutdown fight has come late enough in the congressional calendar to leave any would-be challenger with little time to prepare.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p43">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p44">“I have been working hard for the people of Minnesota, and I think the people of Minnesota understand that, including in my party,” Ms. Klobuchar said.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p44">S</button><br><br>
