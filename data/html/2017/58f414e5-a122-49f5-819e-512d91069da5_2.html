        <i>Title: Shooting Brings Rare Comity to the Capital, but Will It Last?</i><br><br>
        <div id="article" onmouseup="annotate()"><span class="para" id="p0">WASHINGTON — The lawmakers trotted from their dugouts at Nationals Park, together in a near-summer air that never quite felt swampy, united in a certainty that the game must go on, just not exactly as it had before.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p0">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p1">A day earlier, on another ball field some seven miles southwest, a gunman had opened fire on members of the Republican congressional baseball team, striking four people — including Steve Scalise, the majority whip of the House of Representatives — who were there for a practice.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p1">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p2">And on Thursday, the capital’s various institutional forces — senators and lobbyists, staff members with a job to do and residents with an evening to spare — joined, for a moment, in a bipartisan rebuttal: Play ball.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p2">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p3">Beneath a mostly cloudless sky, at least by the mid-innings, fans in the stands intermingled red and blue.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p3">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p4">Near the dugout, the president’s daughter Ivanka Trump bantered with Chuck Schumer, the Senate’s top Democrat, who chatted with two of her young children.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p4">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p5">Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader, wore a shirt from Louisiana State University, Mr. Scalise’s alma mater.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p5">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p6">When a video message from President Trump played on the big screen, some of the Democrats in the crowd booed, but less lustily than usual.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p6">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p7">“You are showing the world that we will not be intimidated,” Mr. Trump said.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p7">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p8">“The game will go on.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p8">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p9">Some members of Congress had not expected to stay behind for the annual showdown, with families and district business waiting for them.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p9">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p10">But by nightfall, the decision was clear.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p10">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p11">“We come here, and these members become our family,” Representative John Lewis, Democrat of Georgia, said at the Capitol before a game he had not intended to see.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p11">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p12">He spoke of 1968 and of the political violence he had seen up close as a civil rights leader, invoking Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p12">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p13">Mr. Lewis, now 77, stared straight ahead for a moment.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p13">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p14">“I have to stay,” he said softly.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p14">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p15">All day, before as more than 24,000 ticket holders filed in for the charity game, the shorthand for other tragedies ricocheted through the Capitol.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p15">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p16">At work on Thursday, those pangs visited lawmakers like a too-familiar houseguest — stalking them down the Capitol’s corridors, past the Senate chamber where a ferocious health care debate had already resumed, along the hall where some had stood one day earlier as survivors, still in dusted cleats and uniforms, unharmed but unsettled.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p16">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p17">The reaction would be different this time, some said.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p17">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p18">More sustainable.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p18">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p19">It had to be. Probably. Maybe. Right?</span>	<button class="sent" id="p19">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p20">“What’s the half-life?” asked Senator Roger Wicker, Republican of Mississippi, appraising how long the comity might last.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p20">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p21">“I don’t know. I don’t know.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p21">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p22">The skepticism is near-universal.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p22">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p23">Even one day out from the initial anguish, much of the political ecosystem seemed unchanged.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p23">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p24">In a Thursday morning tweet, Mr. Trump railed against the “WITCH HUNT” of investigations of his associates.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p24">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p25">Elected officials accused one another of hypocrisy and selective memory on matters of policy, perhaps a bit more gently than they might have on a typical weekday.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p25">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p26">Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, said he was warming up with Sean Hannity, the Fox News host, who is not known for bipartisan spirit.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p26">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p27">And Ms. Pelosi could not resist suggesting that Republicans were the initiators of the present rancor.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p27">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p28">“Somewhere in the ’90s, Republicans decided on a politics of personal destruction as they went after the Clintons,” she told reporters earlier on Thursday.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p28">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p29">Moments later, she added, a bit regretfully: “I really am almost sad for myself that I have gone down this path with you, because I don’t think it’s appropriate for us to have the fullest discussion of it.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p29">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p30">It’ll be for another day.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p30">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p31">But for an optimist in the city — and there still seem to be a few — there were flourishes to appreciate.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p31">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p32">House interns hauled signs: “Scalise Strong,” “Capitol Police MVP” and “Unvidvided” in red, white, and blue.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p32">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p33">Another attendee delivered this message, held aloft: “This Democrat is here to support Congressman Scalise.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p33">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p34">Get well soon, sir.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p34">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p35">Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the Democratic whip, resolved to wear a “Team Scalise” shirt to the game.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p35">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p36">Ms. Pelosi sat for an interview alongside Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p36">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p37">The Senate leaders — Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, and Mr. Schumer of New York — did the same.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p37">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p38">“We don’t dislike each other,” Mr. McConnell said, deploying a rare complimentary double negative.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p38">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p39">Among those on the field before the game was Representative Roger Williams, Republican of Texas, whose aide Zachary Barth was shot at the practice.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p39">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p40">Mr. Williams, a coach on the team, trudged out on crutches after injuring his foot in the Wednesday morning fray as well.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p40">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p41">David Bailey, a Capitol Police officer who was wounded while helping to stop the attack, threw out the ceremonial first pitch.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p41">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p42">(The ball was delivered to the mound, in an apparent bit of sponsorship oddity, by a Budweiser Clydesdale.)</span>	<button class="sent" id="p42">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p43">Mr. Scalise remained in the hospital on Thursday after a second surgery for internal injuries and a broken leg.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p43">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p44">Doctors said his condition was critical but improving.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p44">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p45">He received a standing ovation when he was introduced as a team member, with Democrats waving their caps at his image on the screen beyond the outfield fence.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p45">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p46">“Maybe with a little more time, the teams would be mixed,” suggested Representative Ted Deutch, Democrat of Florida.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p46">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p47">“But at least for now, the healthy competition will bring us together.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p47">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p48">Several elements of the evening did diverge sharply from the ballpark’s standard, professional fare — commonplace for a congressional game that has, since 1909, produced a steady torrent of middling baseball, worse trash talk and more than occasional injury.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p48">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p49">By the concessions, attendees discussed field director salaries and legislative wrangling.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p49">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p50">Khakis filled the grounds.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p50">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p51">A cutout of the head of Representative Tim Ryan, Democrat of Ohio, was held high.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p51">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p52">Chants of “We love you, Pelosi!” rang out briefly, until the minority leader acknowledged them.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p52">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p53">Supporters from both parties raised hot dogs and beers, catching up on acquaintances in common.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p53">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p54">“We’re just one day removed, so it still feels different, I think,” Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, said before the game, recalling past tragedies that many swore would reshape the nation’s politics.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p54">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p55">“I hope it lasts.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p55">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p56">At the practice on Wednesday, Mr. Flake had raced to Mr. Scalise’s side to provide water and first aid after the shooting stopped.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p56">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p57">He set out a goal for himself and his colleagues, uttered before inside the Capitol.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p57">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p58">“Tone down our own rhetoric and not ascribe the worst motives to our colleagues,” he said hopefully.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p58">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p59">“That can be done.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p59">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p61">A little before 10 p.m., the Democrats secured their final out for an 11-2 victory, taking a 40-to-39 edge in the lifetime series.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p61">S</button><br><br>
