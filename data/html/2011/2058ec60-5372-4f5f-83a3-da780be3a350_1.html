        <i>Title: Justices Take Up Crucial Issue in Wal-Mart Suit</i><br><br>
        <div id="article" onmouseup="annotate()"><span class="para" id="p0">WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court appeared closely divided on Tuesday during arguments over the theory put forth by the plaintiffs in an enormous sex discrimination class-action case against Wal-Mart.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p0">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p1">Even some justices who seemed sympathetic to the plaintiffs expressed qualms about how to administer a lawsuit involving as many as 1.5 million women seeking back pay that could amount to billions of dollars.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p1">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p2">Others appeared worried about the consequences for other businesses of a ruling that would allow the case against Wal-Mart to go forward.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p2">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p3">The mere certification of a class-action suit can prompt defendants to settle in light of the sums at stake, and the justices struggled to find a way to distinguish between gaps in pay that might have benign explanations and those caused by unlawful discrimination.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p3">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p4">The court of Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. has recently issued a series of rulings in favor of plaintiffs suing for employment discrimination that cut against the court’s pro-business reputation.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p4">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p5">The Wal-Mart case dwarfs those rulings in importance.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p5">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p6">It is the largest employment discrimination class action in history, and the court’s decision, expected by June, will probably be its most important business ruling this term.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p6">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p7">The issue before the justices at Tuesday’s arguments was not whether Wal-Mart, the country’s largest retailer and biggest private employer, discriminated against women who worked there.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p7">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p8">For now, the question in the case, Wal-Mart Stores v. Dukes, No. 10-277, is whether hundreds of thousands of female workers have enough in common to join together in a single lawsuit.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p8">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p9">The plaintiffs’ theory is that a centralized companywide policy gave local managers too much discretion in pay and promotion decisions, leaving Wal-Mart vulnerable to gender stereotypes.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p9">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p10">The plaintiffs have presented sworn statements and statistics to support their claim.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p10">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p11">Wal-Mart calls that evidence unrepresentative and unreliable.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p11">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p12">The company says its policies expressly bar discrimination and promote diversity.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p12">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p13">In any event, the company says, the plaintiffs — who worked in 3,400 stores in 170 job classifications — do not have enough in common to warrant class-action treatment.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p13">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p14">Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said the theory about how the company discriminated — through a central policy conferring local discretion — was internally inconsistent.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p14">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p15">“Your complaint faces in two directions,” he told a lawyer for the plaintiffs.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p15">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p16">But Justice Stephen G. Breyer said Wal-Mart could be held accountable if it failed to take action in the face of reports of discrimination from its stores.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p16">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p17">“Should central management under the law have withdrawn some of the subjective discretion in order to stop these results?” Justice Breyer asked.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p17">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p18">Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg agreed, saying that companies had a responsibility to make sure that women were treated fairly in local workplaces.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p18">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p19">And Justice Elena Kagan said that “excessive subjectivity” may be a policy that violates the civil rights laws.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p19">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p20">But Justice Antonin Scalia was unconvinced.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p20">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p21">“I’m getting whipsawed here,” he told the plaintiffs’ lawyer, Joseph M. Sellers.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p21">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p22">“On the one hand, you say the problem is that they were utterly subjective, and on the other hand you say there is strong corporate culture that guides all of this. Well, which is it?”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p22">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p23">Mr. Sellers responded that “there is this broad discretion given the managers” but that “they do not make their decisions in a vacuum.” Managers, he went on, “are informed by the company about how to exercise that discretion.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p23">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p24">That did not satisfy Justice Scalia.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p24">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p25">“If somebody tells you how to exercise discretion,” he said, “you don’t have discretion.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p25">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p26">Theodore J. Boutrous Jr., a lawyer for Wal-Mart, said the handful of women named as plaintiffs who seek to represent the entire class did not have typical experiences at the company.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p26">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p27">“Each of the plaintiffs have very different stories,” he said.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p27">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p28">“One of them was promoted into a managerial position. One was terminated for disciplinary violations. One was promoted and then had a disciplinary problem and then was demoted.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p28">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p29">He added that “this class includes at least 544 store managers who are alleged to be discriminators and victims.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p29">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p30">Several justices had practical concerns.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p30">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p31">“What seems to me a very serious problem in this case is, how do you work out the back pay?” Justice Ginsburg asked.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p31">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p32">Mr. Sellers said the trial court could rely on statistics culled from company databases, which he said were more reliable than the evidence that might be presented in individualized hearings given the available information about particular pay and promotion decisions.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p32">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p33">Memories have faded, he said, and Wal-Mart did not keep good records.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p33">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p34">Given that, Mr. Sellers said, Wal-Mart’s personnel decisions were “standardless” and “recordless.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p34">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p35">Justice Kennedy responded with a point about the suitability of the case for class-action treatment.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p35">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p36">“If it’s standardless and recordless,” he said, “then why is there commonality?”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p36">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p37">Mr. Boutrous said Mr. Sellers was trying to have it both ways.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p37">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p38">“The problem here, Mr. Sellers says, is that the records are not available,” Mr. Boutrous said.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p38">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p39">“Then he says we’re going to have a proceeding where the district judge relies only on the records that he says are inadequate, to allow a reconstruction of the decision.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p39">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p40">That is not a process known to our jurisprudence.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p40">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p41">It doesn’t comport with due process.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p41">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p42">Several justices voiced concerns about how many companies could be subject to class-action suits if they allowed the case against Wal-Mart to go forward.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p42">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p43">“Is it true,” Chief Justice Roberts asked Mr. Sellers, “that Wal-Mart’s pay disparity across the company was less than the national average?”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p43">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p44">Mr. Sellers said that was not the appropriate comparison. “The comparison that’s relevant,” he said, “is between men and women and Wal-Mart.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p44">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p45">He added later that “Wal-Mart was behind the other large retailers.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p45">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p46">The chief justice also asked Mr. Sellers “how many examples of abuse of the subjective discrimination delegation need to be shown before you can say that flows from the policy rather than from bad actors?”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p46">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p47">After all, he said, “you’re going to have some bad apples” given Wal-Mart’s thousands of stores.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p47">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p48">Mr. Sellers responded that “there is no minimum number” in court decisions.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p48">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p49">Justices Kennedy and Samuel A. Alito Jr. said they were concerned about companies whose pay and promotion gaps mirror national numbers where there is no proof of a discriminatory policy.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p49">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p50">“So, you have the company that is absolutely typical of the entire American work force,” Justice Alito said.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p50">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p51">“Then you would say every single company is in violation of Title VII” of the Civil Rights Act?</span>	<button class="sent" id="p51">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p52">“That could very well be the case,” Mr. Sellers said.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p52">S</button><br><br>
