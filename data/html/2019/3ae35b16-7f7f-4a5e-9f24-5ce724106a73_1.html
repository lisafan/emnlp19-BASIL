        <i>Title: Trump Declares National Emergency To Fund U.S.-Mexico Border Wall</i><br><br>
        <div id="article" onmouseup="annotate()"><span class="para" id="p0">President Donald Trump on Friday declared a national emergency at the southern U.S. border in an effort to unilaterally seize funding to begin building his long-promised wall between the U.S. and Mexico.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p0">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p1">Trump, who was accompanied by parents of children killed by unauthorized immigrants, said he was declaring the national emergency for “virtual invasion purposes.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p1">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p2">But he also acknowledged another reason: He didn’t want to wait on Congress to approve the funds.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p2">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p3">“I could do the wall over a longer period of time ― I didn’t need to do this,” Trump said in a televised speech, even as he contended the situation on the southern border amounted to a national emergency.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p3">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p4">“But I’d rather do it much faster.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p4">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p5">Trump is also expected to approve Congress’ spending bill, which grants him $1.375 billion for the wall, as opposed to the $5.7 billion he initially demanded.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p5">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p6">The national emergency declaration gives Trump a chance to reroute other government money to fund the project ― and sets up a legal battle that could tie up the president’s signature project for months or years.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p6">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p7">To justify the wall, Trump repeatedly insisted criminals, gang members and drug traffickers were pouring over the border and that only a wall could stop them.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p7">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p8">“We have far more people trying to get into our country today than probably ever before,” Trump said.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p8">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p9">In fact, arrests for illegal border crossings are at their lowest levels since the 1970s.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p9">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p10">There were roughly 520,000 arrests for unauthorized border crossings last year, which is about one-third of the 1.6 million arrests that happened in 2000.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p10">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p11">Since 2014, a high proportion of those crossing have been Central American children and families seeking to make humanitarian claims such as asylum.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p11">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p12">The total wall funding will now come to about $8 billion, partially approved by Congress but mostly by Trump alone.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p12">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p13">That will buy the administration some 234 miles of border wall, a senior administration official told reporters Friday.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p13">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p14">The national emergency declaration will allow the Trump administration to use about $3.6 billion from Defense Department construction projects to build the wall, along with another $2.5 billion the department had allocated for counter-drug activities, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney told reporters.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p14">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p15">The Trump administration also plans to take executive action to move about $200 million from the Department of Homeland Security and another $600 million from the Treasury Department’s asset forfeiture account.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p15">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p16">None of the money will come from hurricane relief, Mulvaney said.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p16">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p17">The DHS funding bill included restrictions on where new border wall could be constructed.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p17">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p18">Those restrictions won’t apply to the portions built with national emergency money, a senior administration official said.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p18">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p19">Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) announced Thursday on the Senate floor that Trump planned to sign the bill and declare a national emergency at the same time, adding that he supported the decision.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p19">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p20">Congress passed a government funding bill Thursday evening.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p20">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p21">McConnell warned Trump in private that declaring an emergency would spark a backlash among Republicans, according to The Washington Post.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p21">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p22">A national emergency declaration grants a president the ability to circumvent certain government rules so that an administration can respond to a crisis.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p22">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p23">In this case, Trump is sidestepping Congress so that he can gain access to certain federal funds without congressional approval.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p23">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p24">Administration officials cited dozens of previous national emergency declarations, insisting that Trump would not break with historical precedent by “unlocking” new pots of money for the border wall he seeks.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p24">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p25">“It’s not as if he just didn’t get what he wanted so he’s waving a magic wand and taking a bunch of money,” Mulvaney said.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p25">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p26">The move is almost certain to be challenged in court.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p26">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p27">“Any crisis on our border is of President Trump’s own making: family separations, child detention, turning our backs on asylum seekers, and more.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p27">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p28">There is no national emergency,” California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, who has sued the Trump administration multiple times, said in a statement.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p28">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p29">“If Trump oversteps his authority and abandons negotiations with Congress by declaring a fabricated national emergency, we won’t only call his bluff, we will do what we must to hold him accountable.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p29">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p30">Prior to the declaration, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) called the proclamation a “gross abuse of the power of the presidency” and vowed that “Congress will defend our constitutional authorities.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p30">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p31">For two months, Democrats in Congress have been enmeshed in stalled negotiations with Trump as he refused to accept anything less than $5.7 billion in the federal budget for his border wall.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p31">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p32">The stalemate caused a record-breaking partial government shutdown that forced an estimated 800,000 government employees to go without pay for 35 days.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p32">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p33">Trump reopened the government for three weeks on Jan. 25, allowing government workers to get back to work as border security negotiations continued.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p33">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p34">In January, Trump asserted that he had “the absolute right to declare a national emergency,” according to CNN.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p34">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p35">He called it “the easy route” while insisting that he’d rather Congress approve his border wall funding.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p35">S</button><br><br>
