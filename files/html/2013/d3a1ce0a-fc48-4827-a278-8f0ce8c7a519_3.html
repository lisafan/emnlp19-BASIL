<span class="para" id="p1">Governor Appoints Ex-Aide to Fill Kerry’s Seat</span>	<button class="sent" id="p1">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p2">BOSTON — Gov. Deval Patrick on Wednesday appointed William Cowan, a Boston lawyer who is a longtime friend and former aide, to serve as an interim United States senator until voters chose a successor to John Kerry in a special election set for June 25.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p2">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p3">Mr. Cowan, 43, who is known as Mo, is a former partner in the politically connected law firm of Mintz Levin and will become Massachusetts’ first black senator since Edward Brooke, a Republican, held the seat from 1966 to 1978.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p3">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p4">His appointment makes Mr. Cowan the second black member to be seated in the current Senate, after Tim Scott of South Carolina was appointed by Gov. Nikki R. Haley.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p4">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p5">Mr. Patrick had said he wanted to appoint someone who did not want to run for the seat later because that person would have to conduct a campaign while learning the ropes in the Senate, and would be unlikely to do either job well.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p5">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p6">At a packed news conference at the State House, Mr. Cowan said he would not seek the permanent office or use the appointment as a springboard later.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p6">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p7">“This is going to be a very short political career,” he vowed.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p7">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p8">The clock is now ticking toward the special election.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p8">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p9">It promises to be another bruising campaign, with two Democratic congressmen likely to face off in a primary in April.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p9">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p10">The biggest question remaining in this drawn-out episode, which began last fall when Mr. Kerry’s name surfaced as a possible successor to Hillary Rodham Clinton as secretary of state, is whether former Senator Scott P. Brown, a Republican, will jump in.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p10">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p11">Mr. Brown has remained mum on the subject, and his camp has sent few signals about his intentions, but he may find the opportunity hard to resist.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p11">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p12">Polls show him beating Representative Edward J. Markey, the only Democrat who has officially declared his candidacy.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p12">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p13">Mr. Brown has high name recognition and money left over from his unsuccessful race last year against Elizabeth Warren.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p13">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p14">If he entered the race and won, Mr. Brown would be in the awkward position of becoming the junior senator to Ms. Warren, even though she has been in office only a few weeks.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p14">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p15">The Senate historian said that those who return to the Senate after leaving — like Dan Coats of Indiana and Frank R. Lautenberg of New Jersey, for example — lose their seniority, although the distinction has little meaning beyond a way to refer to a state’s senators in the formal oratory of the Senate floor.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p15">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p16">Still, it would be unusual for a state to have two senators who had run against each other, especially in a race that was particularly hard fought.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p16">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p17">The June 25 special election would be Mr. Brown’s third statewide Senate race in three years, starting with his win in a special election in January 2010 to finish Senator Edward M. Kennedy’s term.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p17">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p18">If he won, he would presumably run in 2014 for a full six-year term — or four statewide races in nearly five years.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p18">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p19">So far, the only Democrat in the race is Mr. Markey, 66, a liberal and dean of the state’s Congressional delegation.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p19">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p20">Several Democrats, including Mr. Kerry, have closed ranks behind him in the hopes of discouraging anyone else from getting in and avoiding a bruising primary.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p20">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p21">But Representative Stephen F. Lynch, a conservative Democrat from South Boston, is expected to announce Thursday that he will challenge Mr. Markey.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p21">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p22">The primary would be held on April 30.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p22">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p23">The rough and tumble of the coming campaign seemed far away at Wednesday’s news conference, which was attended by Mr. Cowan’s wife, Stacey, and their two young sons.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p23">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p24">“He’s cool,” Lt. Gov. Timothy Murray said of Mr. Cowan. “Tom Brady, George Clooney, James Bond and the president have nothing on Mo.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p24">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p25">Mr. Cowan, who usually wears a bow tie but opted not to for this occasion, is a former chief of staff and chief legal counsel to Mr. Patrick, the state’s first black governor.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p25">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p26">From 1997 to 2009, he practiced civil litigation as an associate and later a partner in the Boston office of Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky & Popeo.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p26">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p27">He also served as a special assistant district attorney in Middlesex County.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p27">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p28">He left the Patrick administration last year to return to the private sector, but said this brief detour to Washington was a sacrifice worth making because he wanted to give something back to the state that had given him so much.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p28">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p29">Mr. Cowan said at the news conference that he was proud to take the post, noting that his mother, who was home in North Carolina recovering from knee surgery, was a child of the segregated South and had not attended college.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p29">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p30">The death of Mr. Cowan’s father at a young age left her to raise her children alone.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p30">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p31">Despite her hardships, he said, “My mother told me that days like this were possible.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p31">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p32">He seemed to be a quick study in the senatorial art of not answering questions definitively.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p32">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p33">Asked, for example, if he would vote for military cuts if they cost jobs in Massachusetts, he called for “a balanced approach,” with some cuts and some revenue growth.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p33">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p34">Mr. Patrick showed similar deftness, skirting a question about why he had not picked former Representative Barney Frank, who had asserted that he would have loved the interim appointment.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p34">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p35">Mr. Cowan said that he would be relying on Mr. Kerry’s staff in Washington and in Massachusetts for guidance and that he intended to continue Mr. Kerry’s work.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p35">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p36">“There won’t be any daylight there at all,” he said.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p36">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p37">Mr. Patrick, who has served as a mentor to Mr. Cowan, was asked whether he saw some of himself in Mr. Cowan.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p37">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p38">“I’m not that cool,” the governor replied.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p38">S</button><br><br>
