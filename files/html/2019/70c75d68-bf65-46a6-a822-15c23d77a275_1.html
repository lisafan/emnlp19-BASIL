        <i>Title: Trump’s immigration offer brings sharp reactions from Dems and GOP</i><br><br>
        <div id="article" onmouseup="annotate()"><span class="para" id="p0">President Trump’s immigration compromise package to end the partial government shutdown drew sharp reactions from Democratic and Republican lawmakers alike.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p0">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p1">In a televised White House address on Saturday afternoon, Trump offered Democrats a three-year extension of protections for 700,000 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients, in exchange for the $5.7 billion he has been seeking for a barrier along the nation's southern border with Mexico.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p1">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p2">“Our immigration system should be a source of pride ... not a source of shame as it is all over the world,” Trump said in his plea.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p2">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p3">The president’s proposal was met with disdain from an array of top Democratic lawmakers.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p3">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p4">Many used the same language in their critiques, accusing Trump of holding the government and federal workers "hostage."</span>	<button class="sent" id="p4">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p5">House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., tweeted, “What we didn’t hear from the President was any sympathy for the federal workers who face so much uncertainty because of the chaos of the #TrumpShutdown.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p5">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p6">Before Trump made his announcement, Pelosi had called his anticipated proposal “a non-starter.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p6">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p7">“For one thing, this proposal does not include the permanent solution for the Dreamers and TPS recipients that our country needs and supports.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p7">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p8">For his part, Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, called Trump's proposal "one-sided and ineffective."</span>	<button class="sent" id="p8">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p9">"It's clear the President realizes that by closing the government and hurting so many American workers and their families, he has put himself and the country in an untenable position.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p9">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p10">Unfortunately, he keeps putting forward one-sided and ineffective remedies.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p10">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p11">There's only one way out: open the government, Mr. President, and then Democrats and Republicans can have a civil discussion and come up with bipartisan solutions."</span>	<button class="sent" id="p11">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p12">Schumer, D-N.Y., concluded, "It was the President who single-handedly took away DACA and TPS protections in the first place – offering some protections back in exchange for the wall is not a compromise but more hostage taking."</span>	<button class="sent" id="p12">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p13">House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer shared a similar sentiment, urging Trump and Sen. Mitch McConnell to "stop holding government hostage and end the shutdown" immediately.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p13">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p14">“The president must stop holding government hostage and end the shutdown so federal employees can get back to work serving the American people.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p14">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p15">There is no reason for Americans to be shut out of work and without a paycheck while negotiations take place on the best way to secure our borders,” he said.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p15">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p16">Hoyer said negotiation can progress after the government reopens.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p16">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p17">“With the government open, we can negotiate an agreement to strengthen border security that both sides can support and that is in the best interests of the American people.”</span>	<button class="sent" id="p17">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p18">Another leading Dem, Sen. Kristen Gillibrand of New York, who announced her White House bid on Jan. 15 in an episode of "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert," said Trump's offer was a "bad deal."</span>	<button class="sent" id="p18">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p19">Gillibrand tweeted: "Trump ordered the end of DACA and TPS.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p19">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p20">Then he shut down the government.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p20">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p21">Now he's holding federal workers hostage, saying he'll temporarily give back what he took away -- only if we give him a pointless, ineffective wall he falsely promised Mexico would pay for.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p21">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p22">This is a bad deal."</span>	<button class="sent" id="p22">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p23">Then there was New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez's response. He bluntly accused Trump of forcing "a pointless shutdown" to pay for the border wall.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p23">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p24">"This is about more than 800,000 Americans who are being held hostage by a President who has forced a pointless shutdown to pay for an expensive, ineffective wall.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p24">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p25">This is not about immigration.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p25">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p26">Dreamers and TPS recipients are not bargaining chips.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p26">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p27">It's unacceptable that after taking away DACA protections, eliminating the TPS program for thousands of immigrants and creating a humanitarian crisis at the border, President Trump is offering temporary solutions in exchange for a permanent wall."</span>	<button class="sent" id="p27">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p28">The Democratic senator also said "a legitimate negotiation" can proceed after the government is reopened.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p28">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p29">Fellow Democratic Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware slammed McConnell for refusing "to meaningfully negotiate with Senate Democrats," but also called Trump's offer "a first step toward comprehensive immigration reform."</span>	<button class="sent" id="p29">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p30">"This senseless government shutdown is hurting millions of Americans, and its impacts are only getting worse. The President should re-open the government so that Republicans and Democrats in Congress can work with the White House to find a sensible solution on border security and immigration.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p30">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p31">I am confident that a reasonable compromise can be reached, but not while President Trump continues to keep significant parts of the government shut down and Leader McConnell refuses to meaningfully negotiate with Senate Democrats," he said.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p31">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p32">"Some relief for Dreamers and an extension of Temporary Protected Status represent a first step toward comprehensive immigration reform, but more ideas from members of both parties should be taken up and debated.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p32">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p33">Republicans and Democrats stand ready to work toward a solution, but the fact remains that there is no reason to have large parts of the federal government shut down while we debate appropriate border security and immigration policies."</span>	<button class="sent" id="p33">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p34">Republican lawmakers, at the opposite end of the reaction spectrum, praised the president for his willingness to negotiate.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p34">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p35">Senate Majority Leader McConnell, for instance, commended the president "for taking bipartisan steps toward addressing current immigration issues."</span>	<button class="sent" id="p35">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p36">In his statement, he said; “Compromise in divided government means that everyone can’t get everything they want every time.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p36">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p37">The president’s proposal reflects that.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p37">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p38">It strikes a fair compromise by incorporating priorities from both sides of the aisle."</span>	<button class="sent" id="p38">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p39">“This bill takes a bipartisan approach to re-opening the closed portions of the federal government.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p39">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p40">It pairs the border security investment that our nation needs with additional immigration measures that both Democrat and Republican members of Congress believe are necessary.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p40">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p41">Unlike the bills that have come from the House over the past few weeks, this proposal could actually resolve this impasse.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p41">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p42">It has the full support of the President and could be signed into law to quickly reopen the government."</span>	<button class="sent" id="p42">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p43">Republican Whip Steve Scalise called on Democrats to match Trump's willingness to negotiate.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p43">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p44">"The time for political games has long passed.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p44">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p45">Democrats must put their personal dislike of the president aside, end their obstruction, and finally come to the negotiating table.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p45">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p46">It's time Democrats do what is right for the functioning and security of our nation and agree to a deal that opens our government, and includes funding for a border wall and other measures to solve this serious immigration crisis at our southern border," he said in a statement.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p46">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p47">Also on the Republican side, Sen. Susan Collins of Maine said she was "hopeful" for a "constructive debate" with Democrats.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p47">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p48">“Compromise is not a sign of weakness — it’s a sign of strength, particularly when hundreds of thousands of families are being harmed.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p48">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p49">The Administration, Senate Republicans, and Democrats must now resolve this stalemate before 800,000 federal workers and their families miss yet another paycheck, and our economy is further damaged,” she said.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p49">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p50">Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, whose views on the president and his policies have fluctuated, said Trump "put forth a reasonable, good faith proposal that will reopen the government and help secure the border."</span>	<button class="sent" id="p50">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p51">He tweeted, "I look forward to voting for it and will work to encourage my Republican and Democratic colleagues to do the same.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p51">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p52">Earlier, while speaking in Ogden, Utah, Romney said he did not understand Pelosi's position on border security.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p52">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p53">"You (Pelosi) and your fellow Democrats have voted for over 600 miles of border fence in the past, why won't you vote for another few miles now? I don't understand their position, I really don't," the Republican senator said.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p53">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p54">Florida Sen. Marco Rubio took a positive view of Trump's proposed deal, like his fellow Republicans.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p54">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p55">He said Trump made "a very reasonable offer" and urged Democrats to work with him.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p55">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p56">“The way to end this shutdown is for both sides to make mutual concessions in order to reach an agreement.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p56">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p57">The president has made a very reasonable offer to extend DACA and TPS protections in exchange for the border security measures he supports.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p57">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p58">I hope that instead of choosing the road of endless obstruction, Democrats will decide to work with him to reach an agreement and end the shutdown,” he said.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p58">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p59">Likewise, House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy called the president's immigration offer "reasonable."</span>	<button class="sent" id="p59">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p60">McCarthy tweeted: "President Trump has put forward a serious and reasonable offer to reform parts of our broken immigration system and reopen government.</span>	<button class="sent" id="p60">S</button><br><br>

<span class="para" id="p61">The moment now turns to Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer. The country is watching."</span>	<button class="sent" id="p61">S</button><br><br>
